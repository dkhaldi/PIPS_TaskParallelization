Usage: ylwrap [--help|--version] INPUT [OUTPUT DESIRED]... -- PROGRAM [ARGS]...

Wrapper for lex/yacc invocations, renaming files as desired.

  INPUT is the input file
  OUTPUT is one file PROG generates
  DESIRED is the file we actually want instead of OUTPUT
  PROGRAM is program to run
  ARGS are passed to PROG

Any number of OUTPUT,DESIRED pairs may be used.

Report bugs to <bug-automake@gnu.org>.
