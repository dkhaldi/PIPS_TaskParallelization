# This makefile forwards make targets to sub-directories...
# It must be used with GNU make (or some make that supports -C)
#
# If you do 'gmake FOO' in a directory with this Makefile
# then 'gmake FOO' is done downwards in the sub-directories.
# Gmake automatically forward make macros of the command line,
# thus 'gmake CC=mycc all' will also forward the CC macro.
#
# 5 macros are of special interet for the make target forwarding process:
#
# FWD_DIRS:
#   the list of sub directories for forwarding commands.
#   if speficied, the target are only forwarded to these directories.
#   the default value is all sub-directories.
# FWD_MKFLAGS:
#   additional flags for make
# FWD_MSG:
#   message to print when reporting failure or success of a sub-make.
#   the default is no message.
# FWD_OUT:
#   where to redirect the output. default is nothing (stderr/stdout).
#   one can suggest "2>&1 > /dev/null" for keeking stderr on stdout.
# FWD_REPORT:
#   where to report failures or successes.
#   may be a pipe, a redirection as "> /dev/null", "" or "> file"...
#   the default is to report to stderr.
# FWD_ROOT:
#   relative directory from the start of the forward process.
#   the default value is "." (current directory).
# FWD_STOP_ON_ERROR:
#   if set, stop on the first failure met.
# FWD_PARALLEL:
#   if set to 1, run targets in parallel
#
# These variables may be overwritten on the command line as
# gmake FWD_DIRS="foo" FWD_MSG="argh!" FWD_REPORT="> /dev/null" FWD_ROOT=$PWD
# Their value is printed with special target "debug_forward_makefile"
# (which is also forwarded:-)
# the default target is all.
#

# doxygen is a target to do, even if there is such a directory/file with
# this name:
.PHONY: doxygen
