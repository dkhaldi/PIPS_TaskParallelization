\chapter{PAWS - Towards PIPS as Web Service}

This first chapter introduces the idea of creating PaWS framework. It
answers two questions: why it is needed? and on what it is based? Design
constraints and functional requirements also are presented here. They
resulted in the emergence of three main modes for PaWS. They are
described in the next section (?). The last part of this chapter presents
the creation process of PaWS.

\section{Conclusion}

PaWS is a lightweight and easy to use application, although it lies on
top of a very complex toolkit, which is PIPS. The design contraints
and requirements were evolving over time, using feedback from the
previous iteration. Different user modes, with a significant amount of
examples, were added.  It was necessary to provide flexibility in
configuring and maintaining PaWS. It required using good architectural
solution and proven tools or libraries. These issues are described in
the subsequent chapters.
