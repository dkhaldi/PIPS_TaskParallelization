BEGIN ChangeDirectory
Enter the directory path in the 'Change Directory' window
and press the OK button.
END

----------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN CreateWorkspace
Enter the workspace name in the 'Create Workspace' window
and press the OK button (or CR or TAB). This name does not 
matter, although it is better to have it related to your goal.

When you are finished, you can destroy the workspace without
loosing any information.

In case of name conflict, you will be warned.
END

----------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN MultipleChoice
Select one or more items from the scrolling list by clicking 
the left mouse button while pointing on the items. 

Press OK when you are done with choosing items.

The current list of items is permanetly shown in the 'Current 
Choices' message pad.  
END

----------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN SingleChoice
Select a single item from the scrolling list by clicking the
left mouse button while pointing on the item, then press OK.

The current item is permanently shown in the 'Current Choice'
message pad.  
END

----------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN Workspace
A workspace is a subdirectory containing the set of Fortran
modules, main program, subroutines or functions, which should
be analyzed interprocedurally. Most commands apply to the
'current' workspace.

A workspace is created or selected or deleted with the 
'Workspace' menu. The current workspace name can also be typed.
A workspace cannot be open unless there are some Fortran source
files in the current directory. A workspace creation includes
the selection of source files. Once the workspace has been
created, no source files can be added or removed. In case a
module is missing or useless, a new workspace must be created.

The workspace directory contains not only the source files but
all files generated by PIPS. All internal data structures can be
saved on disk (see 'Quit' menu) and used again by another wpips
session or by any other PIPS interface (pips, tpips, epips).

Workspaces can be moved and still stay consistent. Unconsistent
workspaces may be due to a fast 'Quit' (or to a PIPS code 
dump!).
END

----------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN Module
A module is either a main program, a subroutine or a function.
Most wpips commands refer to the current module displayed in the
'Module' field. They cannot be activated unless a module has
been selected.

A module name must only contain UPPER case characters or digits
or underscore because Fortran is case insensitive and because
PIPS maps symbols to their upper case names.

A module may be selected by typing its name or with the 
'Module' menu. This menu contains all modules encountered in
the Fortran files of the current workspace.

The main procedure, when it exists, is the default module. And
so is a unique module!

A module cannot be selected unless a current workspace has been 
defined.
END
----------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN Introduction
To get started:

(1) check that wpips is running in the directory containing 
the Fortran files you want to analyze,

(2) create a workspace and select the Fortran files you are
interested in

(3) select a current module

You then can view different pieces of information about the 
current module ('View' menu), you can apply transformations or 
edit it ('Transform/Edit' menu), you can produce different kinds 
of parallel versions ('Compile' menu).

You can also open the 'Options' panel or select options in the
'Options' menu.

PIPS documentation is available on line, see the last two entries
of the Help menu. Look for the 'technical pages' and there, for
the wpips manual. 
END
----------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN Directory
The current directory is used to create or to open a
'Workspace'.

When a workspace is created, the user can select a subset of the
Fortran files in the current directory (e.g. with the wpips
interface all analyzed files must be in the same directory). 

When a workspace is open, wpips list the valid workspaces in the
current directory.

The current directory cannot be changed when a workspace is 
open. The current workspace should be closed ('Workspace' menu).

The default current directory is the directory used to launch
wpips. It can be changed with the directory menu or by typing
the new directory name (don't forget to type a carriage return).
END
----------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN View
The 'View' menu is used to display information about a module
and its relation ship to its callers and callees.

The 'Sequential View' reflects the current internal 
representation. It is the default view of a module. The 'User
View' is the source code provided by the user. Because PIPS
uses a hierarchical control flow graph, the user view and
the sequential view are different even if no program 
transformation has been applied. The control flow graph can be 
displayed graphically.

The statements in the sequential view of a module can be 
decorated by various abstractions of the store (e.g. transformers,
preconditions,...) or the command (e.g. effects, regions,
complexities). See the 'Options' menu.

The Array data flow graph (DFG) view, the 'Scheduling' view and 
the 'Placement' view are all linked to the Polyhedral Method by 
Pr. Feautrier. They only can be applied to static control 
programs.

The call graph rooted at the current module as well as the
interprocedural control flow graph (ICFG) can be displayed.
The ICFG can be more or less summarized and decorated by
store and command abstractions like statements. See the 
'Options' menu.

The distributed and parallel views imply some kind of automatic
parallelization.

The 'Flint' view is a a la lint interprocedural check of a 
module.
END
----------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN Transform/Edit
Transformations include interactive loop transformations
(unroll, interchange, normalize, strip-mine), memory 
reallocation (scalar and array privatization), control
restructurations, partial evaluation, and dead code 
eliminations.

The internal representation level can be lowered to a three
address style, either to be closer to the backend and/or to
perform some transformation more easily.

The 'Static Controlize' step is used by the Polyhedral Method.
END
----------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN Compile
The 'Compile' menu is used by the HPF compiler.

Other parallelization schemes are accessible thru the 'View'
menu.
END
----------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN Options
Option selection requires some understanding of the algorithms
used in PIPS. See the on-line documentation.

Option selection is easier to use with the option panel.

Not all combination of options are meaningful. Some options
can lead to incorrect code.

For instance, it is not obvious to obtain two consistent views
of a dependence graph and of a parallelized code.
END
----------------------------------------------------------------
BEGIN Log
The log window is useful to follow interprocedural and 
inter-analysis dependences.

Warning and error messages are also preserved.

The log window is reset automatically in case of text overflow.

The log can be processsed to replay a wpips session in a batch
mode with tpips.
