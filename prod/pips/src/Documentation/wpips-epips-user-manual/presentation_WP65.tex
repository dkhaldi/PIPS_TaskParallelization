%\title{Code Generation for distributed memory machines}
%\author{Corinne Ancourt}
%\begin{document}
%\maketitle


To provide accurate results in reasonable time, real applications such
as seismic, fluid mechanics and structure computation applications (that
use large set of data and costly algorithms) need to be widely
parallelized. Distributed memory machines are good candidates for these
applications because they support large number of processors without
the shared memory bottle neck problem.  However, distributed memory machines
are much more difficult to program efficiently than shared memory machines.  Shared memories are
often managed by the hardware. Conscientious programmer must only
restructure its program in order to take care of  cache use.
In distributed memory machines, the distribution of data onto the local 
memories must be designed  carefully in order to keep good performance and 
to avoid too much communications.

Many approaches to generate distributed code have been suggested.
Some are language-based. The programmer has to specify the data
distribution pattern and the parallelism but he does not have to
generate processes nor send/receive pairs between processors.
Processes are automatically derived from the data distribution using
the so-called {\em owner computes rule} and a SPMD model: each
processor executes instruction producing a piece of data located in
its memory.  Send/recei\-ve pairs are derived from the data
distribution and from the instruction reference patterns.


Other approaches are  based on the operating system or/and 
hardware support. A virtual shared memory provides the uniform address space.
Some software mechanisms or complex cache systems maintains the memory consistency.


Three different approaches have been implemented in Pips. The first one
is language-based. High Performance Fortran is designed to express data
parallel applications for distributed memory machines. It provides the
user with  a set of directives to specify data distribution and parallelism. A prototype  HPF compiler  is implemented in Pips.

The second  approach is also language-based but the data  distribution and the scheduling are 
automatically computed. Designed for static control programs, this technique
 generates SIMD programs expressed  in CRAFT (Fortran CRAY-T3D) or CM-Fortran.

Finally, the third approach  suggests the emulation of a shared memory onto a
distributed memory machine. Classical parallelization techniques are used
to generate SPMD code. The compiler manages the emulated shared memory and the maintenance of memory coherency.

The following section introduces some characteristics of  these three
 approaches. It focuses on the scheduling differences. More details are 
given   in the associated presentation papers.
 Example presented  in Figure~\ref{ex1} illustrates the approaches.

\begin{verbatim}
    DO I=1,10
S1       B(I,I)=1
    ENDDO
    DO I=1,10
      DO J= I+1,10
S2        B(I,J)=1
S3        A(I,J)=B(I,J-1)
      ENDDO
    ENDDO  
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{HPF program}

In HPF, the  data distribution and the parallelism are specified
 via directives. The
parallel execution of the distributed application is guided by the {\it
owner computes} rule: a processor can update only its local variables. Let's take our example. 

\begin{figure}[htp]
\psfig{file=figures/hpfc1.idraw}
\caption{Data distribution}
\label{hpfc}
\end{figure}

Due to the data dependences existing on the second dimension of Array B, 
the data distribution that minimizes
the communications groups the array elements by rows. Here,
 blocks of 2 rows are distributed onto the 5 processor local memories as 
depicted in Figure~\ref{direct}.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{verbatim}
CHPF$ ALIGN A WITH B
CHPF$ PROCESSORS p1(5)
CHPF$ DISTRIBUTE B(block,*) ONTO p1
\end{verbatim}
\caption{ HPF Directives}
\label{direct}
\end{figure}

According to the {\it owner computes} rule,  2 blocks of
iterations of \verb+J+ are executed on each processor. The corresponding 
generated code is presented in Figure \ref{hpfcc}.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{verbatim}
C
    DO I=2*PROC_ID, 2*PROC_ID+1
S1       B(I,I)=1
    ENDDO
    DO I=2*PROC_ID, 2*PROC_ID+1
      DO J= I+1,10
S2        B(I,J)=1
S3        A(I,J)=B(I,J-1)
      ENDDO
    ENDDO  
\end{verbatim}
\caption{Code generated from HPF}
\label{hpfcc}
\end{figure}

The "HPFC" presentation details all the characteristics of our HPF compiler.

\subsubsection{Automatic placement}

The problem of solving automatically data and control distributions is
NP-complet. Thus, they are sequentially solved. In the suggested approach,
scheduling is first computed. Then, the data distribution computes the mapping
of each array onto a virtual processor grid so as to minimize 
the communication cost.

First, the array data flow graph is built. It characterizes the 
 precedence relations between instruction instances and contains only true 
dependences because the program is put into a single assignment form. 
 Figure \ref{plac} presents these precedence relations for program 1. 
Instructions \verb+S1+ and \verb+S2+ that assign array elements of B, should 
be executed before instruction \verb+S3+. Some array elements are assigned
by \verb+S1+ and others by \verb+S2+. The resulting code generated from the 
DFG is presented in Figure \ref{plac2}

\begin{figure}[htp]
\psfig{file=figures/plac.idraw}
\caption{Precedence Relations}
\label{plac}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{verbatim}
CDIR$ SHARED B1(:BLOCK, :BLOCK)
CDIR$ SHARED B2(:BLOCK, :BLOCK)
CDIR$ SHARED A(:BLOCK, :BLOCK)

CDIR$ DOSHARED(I) ON B1(I,I)
    DO I=1,9
       B1(I,I)=1
    ENDDO

CDIR$ DOSHARED(I,J) ON B2(I,J)
    DO I=1,10
      DO J= I+1,10
        B2(I,J)=1
      ENDDO
    ENDDO  
CDIR$ DOSHARED(I) ON A(I,I+1)
    DO I=1,9
       J= I+1
        A(I,J)=B1(I,J-1)
      ENDDO
    ENDDO  

CDIR$ DOSHARED(I,J) ON A(I,J)
    DO I=1,8
       DO J= I+2,10
        A(I,J)=B2(I,J-1)
      ENDDO
    ENDDO  
\end{verbatim}

\end{figure}

This technique is detailed in the "Polyhedric method" presentation.

\subsubsection{Emulated Shared Memory}


Since the management of data  distribution is complex, this approach suggests
 the emulation of a shared memory onto a
distributed memory machine. Control distribution is applied through {\it 
tiling}. The iteration domain is partitioned into tiles that can be executed 
concurrently on different processors. Figure \ref{wp65d} illustrates this 
tiling and the assignment to the processors.  Tiles  are distributed in
 a cyclic way. 

\begin{figure}[htp]
\psfig{file=figures/wp651.idraw}
\caption{Control distribution}
\label{wp65d}
\end{figure}


Data distribution is implicit.  One half of the processors perform
computations and the other half emulate memory banks.
Figure \ref{wp65c} presents the corresponding generated code for the 
computations. The necessary communications are inserted in the generated code 
automatically by the compiler. The "Distributed code generation" presentation 
 details all the compilation phases of this approach.


\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{verbatim}

    DO I=PROC_ID,10,5
S1       B(I,I)=1
    ENDDO
    DO I=PROC_ID,10,5
      DO J= I+1,10
S2        B(I,J)=1
S3        A(I,J)=B(I,J-1)
      ENDDO
    ENDDO  
\end{verbatim}
