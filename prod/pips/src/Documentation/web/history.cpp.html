The PIPS acronym is overloaded because it simultaneously is the name of
a team, the name of a workbench and the name of a project. The
development of the PIPS compiler workbench by the PIPS team was
performed in different projects:

<ul>
  <li> 1988-91: Initial PIPS project, funded by DRET to evaluate the
potential of interprocedural parallelization for generic parallel
shared-memory machines
  <li> 1989-91: WP65, part of the PUMA project, funded by the ESPRIT
Program (Project 2701); 
automatic compiler-generated emulation of a shared memory for
distributed-memory machines, especially for INMOS T9000 and C104 based
machines
  <li> 1991-93: PIPS-2 project, funded by DRET to exploit generic
techniques developped in project PIPS for Cray vector shared-memory
multiprocessors
  <li> 1992-: <a href="hpfc.html"><b>HPFC</b></a> project, supported by
ARCHIPEL and later by the Paradigme Project; the purpose is to develop
techniques for compiling HPF Fortran
  <li> 1994: Compilation Techniques for Distributed-Memory Machines, joint project with PRISM laboratory and CEA, funded by DRET
  <li> 1996: compilation of signal processing specifications for
				  distributed-memory machines, joint work with
				  Thomson-CSF, funded by DRET.
</ul>
