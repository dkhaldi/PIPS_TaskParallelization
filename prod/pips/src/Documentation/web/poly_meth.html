<a name="intro"><H2> Introduction </H2>

The polyhedric method was invented by <A
HREF="http://www.prism.uvsq.fr/english/parallel/paf/people/PRISM_paf_angl.html">
Paul Feautrier</A> of the <A HREF="http://www.prism.uvsq.fr/">PRiSM
laboratory</A> of University of Versailles (France). Initially, it was
implemented in the parallelizer PAF (Automatic Parallelizer of Fortran)
developped at PRiSM with Le_Lisp. The implementation of this method in the
parallelizer PIPS was carried out under a contract between the University
of Versailles, the Ecole des mines de Paris and the Commissariat &agrave;
l'Energie Atomique (CEA). It has been done in CEA at Centre d'Etudes de
Limeil-Valenton by Benoit de Dinechin and Arnauld Leservot and Alexis
Platonoff <a href="#bibl">[Pla95a]</a>, with the help of Antoine
Clou&eacute; and Francois Dumontet.  <P>

The compilation is a sequence of five phases. The first phase checks that
the imput is a static control program, <i>i.e.</i>, fulfills some
restrictions. The second phase builds an array data flow graph (DFG). The
third one constructs a scheduling function compatible with the DFG. This
function minimizes the execution time for an unbounded PRAM. The fourth
one computes a mapping value for a physical distributed memory parallel
machine. Finally, the last phase generates the parallel code.  <P>

Although this compilation scheme is implemented in PIPS, it is NOT
interprocedural yet.  <P>

<HR>

<a name="stco"><H2>Static Control</H2>

This method is limited to a certain class of programs called <em>static
control programs</em> <a href="#bibl">[Fea91]</a>. In such programs, the
authorized statements are:

<UL>
<LI> DO loop and the IF test control structures;
<LI> assignment and input/output statements;
</UL>

Also, loop bound expressions and array subscript expressions must be
integer affine functions of surrounding loop indices and <i>structure
parameters</i>.  A <em>structure parameter</em> is an integer variable
defined only once in the program, typically a constant that defines the
size of the arrays.  <P>

<HR>

<a name="adfg"><H2>Array Data Flow Graph</H2>

The <em>Array Data Flow Graph</em> (DFG) is computed from a static control
program <a href="#bibl">[Fea91]</a>. The DFG is in fact a kind of
dependence graph in which only true dependences appear. Arrays and scalars
are expended (implicitly) and assigned only once. <P>

To each node of the DFG are associated an <em>instruction</em> and an
<em>execution domain</em>. The execution domain is a set of constraints
specifying the variation domain of the surrounding loop indices of the
instruction.  <P>

Nodes are connected by arcs which represent true data dependences. To each
edge of the DFG are associated the <em>reference</em> of the use
dependence, a <em>transformation function</em> in which each index of the
definition iteration domain is expressed as a linear function of the
indices of the use iteration domain, and a <em>governing predicate</em>
that specifies the sub-space of the sink's iteration domain on which the
edge exists (it is a system of constraints upon the indices of the sink's
iteration domain).  <P>

<HR>

<a name="bdt"><H2>Scheduling</H2>

The scheduling function is computed from the DFG <a
href="#bibl">[Fea92a]</a> to minimize the total execution time with no
resource constraint. The schedule provides for each operation of a program
the logical date at which it must be executed. For an occurence of indice
<tt>s</tt>, it is expressed as a multidimensional affine function
<tt>Ts</tt> of the loop indices and the structure parameters.  <P>

For a given time <tt>t</tt>, the scheduling function defines a set of
independent operations which can be executed simultaneously.  This set is
called a front. The execution of two successive fronts must be sequential.
<P>

Even with the static control restrictions, it is not possible to always
have a unidimensional linear schedule. Typically, this happens when there
are two or more sequential loops in the same loop nest.  In that case, a
<em>multidimensional</em> linear schedule is computed <a
href="#bibl">[Fea92b]</a>.  <P>

<HR>

<a name="plc"><H2>Mapping</H2>

The placement function associates to each statement a multidimensional
affine function of the loop indices and the structure parameters <a
href="#bibl">[Fea93]</a>. This function specifies explicitly the placement
of the instruction on a virtual processor grid, <i>i.e.</i>, gives the
identity of the processor that executes each occurence of the instruction.
<P>

Each dimension of the placement function defines a placement direction for
the instruction and all these directions constitute the distribution space
of the target machine.  The number of dimensions to compute is arbitrary
with a maximum equal to the dimension of iteration space minus the
dimension of the scheduling function. <P>

Initially, the goal of the algorithm that computes the placement function
was to reduce the number of communications. For an edge of the DFG, there
is a potential communication between its source and its destination, which
can be represented by a distance.  If such a distance is equal to zero
(the edge is ``cut'') then the source and the destination will be mapped
onto the same processor, and there will be no communication at all.  <P>

The principle of the method is to nullify as many distances as possible.
To each edge is associated a <em>cutting condition</em> represented by a
system of equalities. The length of an edge is nullified if its cutting
condition is satisfied, i.e. its equalities are satisfied.  These
equalities corresponds to the nullification of the factors of the
variables (loop indices and structure parameters) appearing in the
distance.  In most cases, satisfying the cutting conditions of all the
edges will lead to the trivial solution: some null dimensions,
<i>i.e.</i>, all the occurences of the instruction are placed on the same
processor. To avoid this, some edges should not be cut. To choose them, a
greedy algorithm has been proposed <a href="#bibl">[Fea93]</a>, it treats
the edges by decreasing importance. The importance of an edge is
represented by its weight which is equal to the volume of data which has
to be sent if the edge is not cut.  <P>

This method does not take into account the type (and hence the temporal
cost) of the communications. To that purpose, an extension of the method
has been implemented. It is based on a special treatment of potential
communications that can be optimized <a href="#bibl">[Pla95b]</a>, for
instance spread, reduction...

<HR>

<a name="coge"><H2>Code Generation</H2>

The final phase builds the parallel program using the results of all
previous phases. At a given time step, the parallel program has to execute
the corresponding front (see above), synchronize and pass to the next time
step. This induces the following general architecture of the parallel
program:<br>

<pre>
do t = 1, number of fronts
  execute concurrently all operations in F(t)
  synchronize
end do
</pre>

The code generation is based upon three transformations:

<dl>
<dt> Total expansion of scalars and arrays:
<dd> transformation of the initial program into a dynamic single
     assignment form <a href="#bibl">[Fea88]</a>.
<dt> Loop reordering:
<dd> rearrangment of the iteration domain of the initial loops according
     to the scheduling and placement functions (the first gives the
     sequential loops, the second the parallel ones). The reordering is
     equivalent to scanning polyhedra with do loops <a
     href="#bibl">[AI91]</a>.
<dt> Reindexing:
<dd> substitution of all the array access functions with new ones computed
     according to the new loops.
</dl>

A general method for generating parallel code from the results of the
preceding phases has been proposed by Collard <a href="#bibl">[CF93]</a>.
<P>

In PIPS, the generated parallel code can be either CM Fortran (for the
CM-5) or CRAFT Fortran (for the Cray-T3D). <P>
