<b>PIPS</b> functionalities are available thru a set of Shell scripts
based on a C program, <a href="pips.html">pips</a>. A workspace must
first be initialized by the <a href="Init.html">Init</a> command which
creates a directory containing the set of Fortran files to analyze and
transform. Different views of each module can be obtained with the <a
href="Display.html">Display</a> command. If a default computation rule
is not satisfactory, if can be changed with the <a
href="Select.html">Select</a> command. Code transformations are
performed with the <a href="Perform.html">Perform</a> command. Finally,
the workspace directory and its content can be removed with <a
href="Delete.html">Delete</a>.

<p>

If a workspace with the same name already exists it is open without
re-initialization by <a href="Init.html">Init</a>.

<p>

The Shell scripts share a common context. A current workspace and module
are memorized as early as possible to simplify the interface and to
minimize the typing effort..

<p>

Four-letter abbreviations for analyses and transformations (via the
so-called <em>resources</em>) can be used.

<p>

See the <em>PIPS user manual</em> (in French) for more information.

Note: a <a href="line-interface.html">line interface</a> and a <a
href="window-interface.html">X-Window interface</a> are also
available. The Shell interface is the less user-friendly interface but
it also is the safest one because memory corruptions cannot be
propagated from on query to the next one, since each of them is an
independent Shell process. The line interface is a nice trade-off
between the security of the Shell interface and the user-friendliness of
the window interface.
