/**
   beware : modifies l1, l2 and their effects

  @param l1 and l2 are two lists of effects.
  @param  r1_r2_combinable_p is a bool function that takes two
          individual effects as arguments and renders true when they are
          considered as combinable ;
  @param  r1_r2_generic_binary_op is a binary operator that combines two
          individual effects whatever their path may be;
  @param  r1_r2_binary_op is a binary operator that combines two
          individual effects on concrete paths; it is called by the previous
	  parameter;
  @param  r1_unary_op is a unary operators that deal with the remnants of l1,
          that is those effects that are not combinable with any effect of l2;
  @param  r2_unary_op is a unary operators that deal with the remnants of l2,
          that is those effects that are not combinable with any effect of l1;

  @return a list of effects, combination of l1 and l2.

  There is a strong assumption on l1 and l2 effects: two effects of l1
  (resp. l2) are not combinable wrt r1_r2_combinable_p.  The algorithm
  relies on this assumption to avoid unecessary comparisons of effects
  when possible, for performance reasons (the asymptotic complexity is
  o(n1*n2), but taking into account this assumption reduces the average
  complexity).

  The algorithm takes into account the fact that if an effect of l1 (resp. l2)
  is an abstract location, it may be combinable with several effects
  of l2 (resp. l1).
  We strongly rely on the abstract locations lattice properties and on the
  list properties to avoid to recursively compute the union of two
  individual effects with the current resulting list.

/**
   @brief computes the union of the two input lists of effects.
   beware : modifies/frees l1, l2 and their effects

  @param l1 and l2 are two lists of effects.
  @param  r1_r2_combinable_p is a bool function that takes two
          individual effects as arguments and renders true when they are
          considered as combinable ;
  @param  r1_r2_union_op is a union operator that combines two
          individual effects;
  @param  r_unary_op is an operator applied to the effects from one
          orignal list that are not combinable with the effects of the
	  other list;

  @return a list of effects, combination of l1 and l2.

  There is a strong assumption on l1 and l2 effects: two effects of l1
  (resp. l2) are not combinable wrt r1_r2_combinable_p.  The algorithm
  relies on this assumption to avoid unecessary comparisons of effects
  when possible, for performance reasons ((the asymptotic complexity is
  o(n1*n2), but taking into account this assumption reduces the average
  complexity).

  The algorithm takes into account the fact that if an effect of l1 (resp. l2)
  is an abstract location, it may be combinable with several effects
  of l2 (resp. l1).
  We strongly rely on the abstract locations lattice properties and on the
  list properties to avoid to recursively compute the union of two
  individual effects with the current resulting list.
