 /* NewGen interface with C3 type Psysteme for PIPS project 
  *
  * Systems of linear equalities and inequalities are stored as a triplet,
  * a base followed by two vector lists, the sets of equalities and 
  * inequalities: (b leq lineq). 
  *
  * Each vector list is also parenthesized:
  * (v1 v2 v3). Each vector itself (see Pvecteur.c) is a parenthesized
  * list of couples value/variable.
  *
  * For instance, the empty system (the whole space as defined by basis b) is:
  *    (b()())
  * where basis vector b is stored as a regular vector (see Pvecteur.c).
  *
  * To cope with the absence of unget() for f(), each vectors in the list
  * is separated by a space.
  *
  * Redundant information, the number of equalities and the number of 
  * inequalities and the system dimension, is discarded.
