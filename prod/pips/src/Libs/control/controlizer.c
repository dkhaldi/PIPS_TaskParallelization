/* \defgroup controlizer Controlizer phase to build the Hierarchical Control Flow Graph

   It computes the Hierarchical Control Flow Graph of a given statement
   according the control hierarchy.

   It is used in PIPS to transform the output of the parsers (the
   PARSED_CODE resource) into HCFG code (the CODE resource).

   For example if there are some "goto" in a program, it will encapsulate
   the unstructured graph into an "unstructured" object covering all the
   gotos and their label targets to localize the messy part. Then this object
   is put into a normal statement so that, seen from above, the code keep a
   good hierarchy.

   In PIPS the RI (Internal Representation or AST) is quite simple so that
   it is easy to deal with. But the counterpart is that some complex
   control structures need to be "unsugared". For example
   switch/case/break/default are transformed into tests, goto and label,
   for(;;) with break or continue are transformed into while() loops with
   goto/label, and so on. It is up to the prettyprinter to recover the
   high level construction if needed (...and possible).

   In the case of C, it is far more complicated than with Fortran77 that
   was targeted by PIPS at the beginning because we need to deal with
   variable scoping according to their block definitions that may not be
   the same hierarchy that the HCFG, for example when you have a goto
   inside a block from outside and when you have local variables in the
   block. In C99 it is even worse since you can have executable
   declarations.

   There are other phases in PIPS that can be used later to operate on the
   CODE to optimize it further.

   Even if there is no fundamental reason that we cannot controlize an
   already controlized code, it is not implemented yet. For example, it
   could be useful to modify some CODE by adding some goto or complex
   control code and call again the controlizer on the CODE to have nice
   unstructured back instead of building correct unstructured statements
   from scratch or using some CODE dump-and-reparse as it is done in some
   PIPS phases (outliner...).

   TODO: a zen-er version of the recursion that avoid passing along the
   successor everywhere since we know at entry that it is the only
   successor of the main control node.

   This is the new version of the controlizer version rewritten by
   Ronan.Keryell@hpc-project.com

 * predecessor or only some of its predecessors belong to the global
 * graph but not to the local graph. So we are interested in
 * predecessors of succ that are reachable from the entry node. Unless
 * we are lucky because succ has only one predecessor and this

 * after the nodes in ctls.
 *
 * @return exit, the existing or newly allocated exit node. The
 * subgraph defined by ctls is updated when a new node is allocated.
 *
 * Two algorithms at least are possible: we can either start from the
 * predecessors of succ and check that a backward control path to the
 * entry of ctls exists, or we can start from entry and look for
 * control paths reaching succ. The second approach is implemented here.

/* Controlize a statement that is in a control node, that is restructure
   it to have a HCFG recursively (a hierarchical control flow graph).

   @param[in,out] c_res is the control node with the main statement to
   controlize. @p c_res should already own the statement at entry that
   will be recursively controlized. @p c_res can be seen as a potential
   unstructured entry node.

   @param[in,out] succ is the successor control node of @p c_res at
   entry. It may be no longer the case at exit if for example the code is
   unreachable or there is a goto to elsewhere in @p_res. @p succ can be
   seen as a potential unstructured exit node.

   @param[in,out] used_labels is a way to define a community of label we
   encounter in a top-down approac during the recursion with their related
   statements. With it, during the bottom-up approach, we can use it to
   know if a statement can be control-hierarchized or not. More
   concretely, it is a hash table mapping a label name to a list of
   statements that reference it, as their label or because it is a goto to
   it. This hash map is modified to represent local labels with their
   local related statements. This table is used later to know if all the
   statements associated to local labels are local or not. If they are
   local, the statement can be hierarchized since there is no goto from or
   to outside location.

   @return true if the current statement isn't a structured control.
