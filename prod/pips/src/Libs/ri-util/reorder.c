/** @file reorder.c

    @brief These functions compute the statement_ordering of their arguments.

    To ease referencing statements, statements are numbered with an
    ordering that is made of 2 parts, an unstructured order that is the
    occurence order of unstructured control node in a depth first visit of
    the RI, and a local order that corresponds to appearance order in a
    depth first visit of the statements inside a control node. This last
    number in reset to one when encountering a control node.

   encountered during depth first visiting  */
