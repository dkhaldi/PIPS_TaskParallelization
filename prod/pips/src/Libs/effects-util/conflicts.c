/**
 * @brief Check if two references may conflict
 *
 * @description Can the two references r1 and r2 access the same
 * memory location when evaluated in two different stores?
 *
 * We have to deal with static aliasing for Fortran and with
 * dynamic aliasing for C and Fortran95.
 *
 * We have to deal with abstract locations used to represent sets of
 * memory locations.
 *
 * A PIPS reference is a memory access path rather than a reference as
 * understood in programming languages:
 *
 * - a field of a struct or a union d can be accessed by subscripting
 *   d with a field number or with a field entity
 *
 * - a dereferencing is expressed by a zero subscript: *p is p[0]
 *
 * - abstract locations such as foo:*HEAP* or foo:*HEAP**MEMORY* or
 *   foo:*HEAP*_v3 can be used
 *
 * - heap modelization uses the malloc statement number as a subscript
 *
 * - flow-sensitive heap modelization can use indices from the
 *   surrounding loops as subscripts
 *
 * - context-sensitive heap modelization can also use function
 *   reference to record the call path
 *
 * Three bool properties are involved:
 *
 * - ALIASING_ACROSS_TYPES: if false objects of different types cannot
 *   be aliased
 *
 * - ALIASING_INSIDE_DATA_STRUCTURE: if false, access paths starting
 *   from the same data structure are assumed disjoint as soon as they
 *   differ. This property holds even after pointer
 *   dereferencement. It is extremely strong and wrong for PIPS source
 *   code, unless persistant is taken into account.
 *
 * - ALIASING_ACROSS_FORMAL_PARAMETERS: if false, access paths
     starting from different parameters cannot conflict.

 * @brief Check if two entities may or must conflict

 * meeting, when abstract locations were added. And now we have store
 * and type declaration dependencies...
 *
 * @param must_p define if we enforce must conflict or only may one
 *
 * Be careful because entity_variable_p(e) does not guarantee that e
 * is a variable defined by the programmer. Maybe another function is
 * needed to make sure that the conversion to an abstract location
 * generates a useful result... variable_entity_p() is not necessarily
 * good either because it uses the entity storage to make a
 * decision. Formal parameters and return values are not taken into
 * account.
 *
 * There no abstract locations for formal parameters and return
 * values, which may not be a good idea if C let you pick up the
 * address of a formal parameter. They have to be handled in a
 * specific way.
 *
 * beware: this function should only be used for scalar entities.
 * however, I do not add an assert for this time, because I don't yet know
 * what damages it may cause...
