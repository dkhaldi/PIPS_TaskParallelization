# This is a Python hack to change a global variable into something more
# dynamic, looking to an environment variable, if any.

# This is needed to allow PyPS to be moved around at other locations than
# envisioned without having to patch this file.


import os

# The name of the variable used to specify where to find the PyPS runtime:
PIPS_PYPS_RUNTIME_DIR_VARNAME = "PIPS_PYPS_RUNTIME_DIR"

def PypsRuntimeDir(default_dir):
    "Overide the string value access with a possible environment variable"
    if PIPS_PYPS_RUNTIME_DIR_VARNAME in os.environ:
        # If the PIPS_PYPS_RUNTIME_DIR_VARNAME environment variable is
        # set, use it:
        return os.environ[PIPS_PYPS_RUNTIME_DIR_VARNAME]
    else:
        # Use the compile-time value:
        return default_dir

# Some test cases:
# Use to be: pypsruntime="/usr/local/par4all%/share/runtime"

# Now the use case is:
#pypsruntime = PypsRuntimeDir("/usr/local/par4all%/share/runtime")
#print pypsruntime
