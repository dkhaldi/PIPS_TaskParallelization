\section{Introduction}

These newgen data structures are used to tell whether a variable
(formal parameter or common variable) in a called procedure must be
checked for used-before-set error or not.

\domain{import entity from "ri.newgen"}
{}

\domain{ubs\_check = module:entity x variable:entity}

\domain{ubs = list:ubs\_check*}
