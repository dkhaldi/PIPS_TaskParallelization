This file contains a few scripts used to build a pips-aware buildbot. It is not
fully functionnal s many things need to be setup, and the whole things relies
on master / slaves exisiting etc, so my former config was not duplicated in a
full reusable one. However I sahre thses files inc as of they can be usefull to
anyone that would attempt a similar approach.

Bascially:
- autoconf.py is a generic module to enhace buildbot's GNUAutoconf [reliable]
- pipsbuild.py implements pips-specific build steps [fairly reliable]
- pipsvalid.py implements simple parsing of pips validation output [not used for a long time]
