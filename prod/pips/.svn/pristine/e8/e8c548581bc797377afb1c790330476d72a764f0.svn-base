# Usage: logfile_to_tpips <workspacename>
#
#	Convert the logfile of the named workspace
#	created by wpips to a tpips source.
#
# Known limitations:
#
#	- does not display all the resources for a
#	  rule creating multiple resources.
#
# TODO: rewrite with some other script language than sh/sed?
# extract all setenv of cpp-related pips variables? (even from pyps)?
# what about adding some options, such as --delete for an initial cleanup?
# see #645
