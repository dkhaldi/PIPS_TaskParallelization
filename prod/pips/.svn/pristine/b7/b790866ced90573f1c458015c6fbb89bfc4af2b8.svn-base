\chapter{Implementation}

PaWS is a very light and portable framework. This is achieved by using
multiple flexible and easy-to-extend technologies and tools, that are
presented in this section. All aspects related to the implementation
of PaWS are introduced with an architecture description and an
overview of specific solutions used. The last part of this chapter
contains information about problems encountered during the development
process.

This chapter must be read to understand how PaWS is working. It is
also a great introduction to Chapter 3, namely the configuration of
the PaWS framework.

\section{Conclusion}

Up to now, the architecture and the tools selected have met all the
requirements (see Section \ref{design_requirements}) and design
contraints (see Section \ref{design_contraints}).
