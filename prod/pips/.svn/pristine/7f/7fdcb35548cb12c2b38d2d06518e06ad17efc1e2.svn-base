<h1>PIPS Distribution</h1>



The PIPS software is distributed no longer distributed in an executable
	  form but only in source code. Note that the source code is not
	  bullet-proof and is large (200,000 lines of C code). Its compilation
	  requires many public-domain tools to be installed, thus we recommend
	  that you use the small script <code>setup_pips.sh</code> to help you
	  to build a PIPS working version you can use as is or as a base for
	  developing new analysis or transformation phases. <p>

When installing PIPS on your system, please read the README and INSTALL
files at the root directory of the distribution for further instructions
on how to run or compile PIPS. For help mail to
<code>pips-support-at-cri.mines-paristech.fr</code>.


<h2>PIPS and tools at the source level</h2>

PIPS and public domain tools PIPS is built upon are available at the
source level.  Note that the code is distributed as is with no warranty,
even implicit, of any kind. It is distributed under the term of the GNU
public license (GPL) that you may find quite easily on the net. <p>

GNU make, cproto, flex, bison and some other tools are required to build
PIPS. See the next section for pointers on how to find and download these
tools which are not included in the basic distribution.

Now everything is available in a SubVersioN repository as described in <A
			HREF="http://svn.cri.mines-paristech.fr/pips.html">http://svn.cri.mines-paristech.fr/pips.html</a>. An
			anonymous access is enough to get the software, but if you
			want to contribute to PIPS, just ask for an account with
			commit access. 

<h2>Other softwares of interest</h2>

Here are (some quite old) pointers to some external software that is used
by PIPS or by PIPS generated codes or for building the PIPS software. This
sofware is generally freely distributed.
<ul>
  <li> <a href=http://www.netlib.org/pvm3>PVM 3.3</a>: for the runtime of 
       <a href=http://www.cri.mines-paristech.fr/pips/hpfc.html>HPFC</a> and
       <a href=http://www.cri.mines-paristech.fr/pips/wp65.html>WP65</a>.
       
  <li> <a href=ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu>GNU software</a>
       (gmake gm4 gtar gzip gcc emacs readline malloc gsed).
       
  <li> <a href=http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/~inform/forschung/daVinci>
       Da Vinci</a> graph displayer.
       
  <li> <a href=HTTP_PUB/cproto-4.3.tar.gz>Cproto 4.3</a>
       (automatic prototype generation for C).
       
  <li> <a href=HTTP_PUB/rman-2.4.tar.gz>Rman 2.4</a>
       (conversion of man pages to html).
       
  <li> <a href=http://www.cis.ufl.edu/perl/>perl 5</a>
       
  <li> <a href=http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/tex2html/doc/latex2html/latex2html.html>LaTeX2Html</a> is also helpful to convert the documentation to html pages.
       
  <li> <a href=ftp://ftp.germany.eu.net/pub/utils/toolpack>Toolpack</a>
       (kit of Fortran to Fortran transformations structurations and so on,
       written in Fortran).
       
  <li> xtree to display call graphs.
</ul>
