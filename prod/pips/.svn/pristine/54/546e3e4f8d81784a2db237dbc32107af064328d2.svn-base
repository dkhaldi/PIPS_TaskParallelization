<b>PIPS</b> functionalities are available thru a set of buttons and
menus. The interface is self-explanatory and on-line help is available.

<p>

Interprocedural and intermediate results are stored in a workspace which
must be created or re-open via the Select button. The same button is
then used to choose a current module. Different views of this module,
corresponding to different analyses, can be displayed with the View
button. The module code can be transformed using the transform menu.

<p>

If default options are not satisfactory, new ones can be chosen with the
Options menu. These options are badly documented on-line. See the pipsmake
documentation.

<p>

It is useful to open the Log window to follow PIPS computation (see the
Log button), especially when interprocedural options have been chosen.

<p>

On quitting, the workspace can be saved on disk in a consistent way for
future use, or destroyed (Ronan: not true!) to terminate the wpips
process faster.

<p>

Note: a <a href="line-interface.html">line interface</a> and a <a
href="batch-interface.html">Shell interface</a> are also available. The
Shell interface is the less user-friendly interface but it also is the
safest one because memory corruptions cannot be propagated from on query
to the next one, since each of them is an independent Shell process. The
line interface is a nice trade-off between the security of the Shell
interface and the user-friendliness of the window interface.
