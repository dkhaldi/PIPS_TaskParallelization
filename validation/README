PIPS validation, i.e. non regression tests, bugs and expected enhancements.

Default validation, i.e. non-regression tests
  (the list of directories in "defaults")

	sh> make validate
or
        sh> make validate-out

The same by replacing "test" files instead of generating
adjoining "out" files:

	sh> make validate-test

For one directory:

	sh> make TARGET=Semantics validate

or

	sh> cd Semantics
	sh> make validate-out

Just for one file:

	sh> cd Semantics
	sh> rm loopequiv.result/test
	sh> make loopequiv.result/test

A validation directory may contain subdirectories with further
test cases to consider.

To change the pips/tpips used for the validation, fix the PATH,
and possibly LD_LIBRARY_PATH if you use dynamic linking:

	sh> PATH=/path/to/pips/binaries:$PATH make validate


Acceptation of differences, possibly for some directories or files, and commit:

	sh> svn ci -m 'what has been done...' test-files-to-accept


Full cleanup of generated files:

	sh> make clean parallel-clean
