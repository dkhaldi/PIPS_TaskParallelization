Combinatorial tests of freia spoc scheduler and wiring.
1005 cases are considered, reduced from 6912 thanks to
symmetries and the constraint that temporaries are used.

To run this validation:

  sh> make generate
  # generate 1005 files
  sh> make validate-test
  # there should be no coredumps, i.e. no remaining databases
  # all SPoC should require one accelerated function only
  # but a few with 3 outputs
  # idem Terapix
  sh> make full-clean
