The read memory effect on f was missed for its first use in function03.c.
It is now OK, but the write any_module:anywhere is a bit excessive if correct.
If the code of the function pointed by f is correct, it cannot change the value of f
because it cannot be visible inside *f(2)...

I'm kind of going Fabien's way. Time to stop and implement proper analyses.
