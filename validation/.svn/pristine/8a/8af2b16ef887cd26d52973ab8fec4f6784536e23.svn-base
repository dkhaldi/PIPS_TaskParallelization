Select some options to deal with the C Language:
Parse as C:
Prettyprint the source as C, of course
Do not display original number lines as comment:
If possible, transform simple for-loops into do-loop à la Fortran, simpler to analyze:
Desugaring other for-loops into plain while-loops fot the time we improve semantics ameliorations in PIPS:
Select the most precise analyses:
Compute the intraprocedural preconditions at the same time as
transformers and use them to improve the accuracy of expression
and statement transformers:
Try to restructure the code for more precision:

Check the proper effects, especially for variable fp and call to fgetc()

void getimage(void)
{
   int i, j;
   unsigned char c;
   FILE *fp;
//             <    is written>: fp
   
   /* To try to avoid fp privatization */
   fp = (void *) 0;
//             <    is written>: i
   
   /* This loops should not be distributed.  On 2009/05/26, if the main()
        is removed, this bug too... */
   for(i = 0; i <= 63; i += 1)
//             <    is written>: j
      for(j = 0; j <= 63; j += 1) {
