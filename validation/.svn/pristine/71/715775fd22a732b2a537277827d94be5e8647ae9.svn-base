C     You cannot be sure that M==6 because there may be several calls to SEMANT

      IF (N.GE.MAXSIZ) THEN                                             0001

C     This loop can be parallelized

      DO 1 I = 1, N, 2                                                  0003

         A(I) = 0.                                                      0004

C  P(I,N) {I==J, 1<=J, J<=N, N<=10}

         A(J+1) = 0.                                                    0005

1        CONTINUE                                                       0006

C  P(I,N) {I==J, J<=12, N+1<=J, N<=10}


C     M is a static variable because of the DATA statement
C     Its value is inherited from one call to the next and
C     pretty much unknown. Although it looks as if it were
C     uninitialized, it is at least initialized by DATA.

      CALL SWAP(N, M)                                                   0007

C  P(I,M,N) {I==J, N==M#init, J<=12, M+1<=J, M<=10}

      PRINT *, N, M                                                     0008
      END
