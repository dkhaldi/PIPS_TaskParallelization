      PROGRAM SYNTHESIS03

C     Goal: debug the code synthesis in initializer()
C     Check that a call graph of this routine can be obtained
C     by automatically generating source code for FOO and BAR

C     Handle arrays as actual arguments and actual expressions
c     whose type should be derived

      COMPLEX C(10)

      CHARACTER*80 S

      CALL FOO(X, I, C, S)                                              0014

      C = BAR(I+1)                                                      0016
