# Code after privatize_module for module PRIVATIZATION09
#
C     Check that j is not privatized in the first loop, but privatized
C     in the second one... However, j is not initialized before its use
C     in the first loop, the value of j does not matter and hence j can
C     be privatized in both loops, But unlike privatization01,f, j is
C     used in the next loop nest. Hence j cannot be privatized.

      INTEGER A(10)
