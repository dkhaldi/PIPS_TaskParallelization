/* These are defined by the user (or the compiler)
   to specify the desired environment:

   __STRICT_ANSI__	ISO Standard C.
   _ISOC99_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C89 from ISO C99.
   _POSIX_SOURCE	IEEE Std 1003.1.
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE	If ==1, like _POSIX_SOURCE; if >=2 add IEEE Std 1003.2;
			if >=199309L, add IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993;
			if >=199506L, add IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995;
			if >=200112L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2004
   _XOPEN_SOURCE	Includes POSIX and XPG things.  Set to 500 if
			Single Unix conformance is wanted, to 600 for the
			upcoming sixth revision.
   _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED XPG things and X/Open Unix extensions.
   _LARGEFILE_SOURCE	Some more functions for correct standard I/O.
   _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE	Additional functionality from LFS for large files.
   _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=N	Select default filesystem interface.
   _BSD_SOURCE		ISO C, POSIX, and 4.3BSD things.
   _SVID_SOURCE		ISO C, POSIX, and SVID things.
   _ATFILE_SOURCE	Additional *at interfaces.
   _GNU_SOURCE		All of the above, plus GNU extensions.
   _REENTRANT		Select additionally reentrant object.
   _THREAD_SAFE		Same as _REENTRANT, often used by other systems.
   _FORTIFY_SOURCE	If set to numeric value > 0 additional security
			measures are defined, according to level.

   The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler defines __STRICT_ANSI__.
   If none of these are defined, the default is to have _SVID_SOURCE,
   _BSD_SOURCE, and _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to
   200112L.  If more than one of these are defined, they accumulate.
   For example __STRICT_ANSI__, _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE
   together give you ISO C, 1003.1, and 1003.2, but nothing else.

   These are defined by this file and are used by the
   header files to decide what to declare or define:

   __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
   __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
   __USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
   __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
   __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
   __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_BSD		Define 4.3BSD things.
   __USE_SVID		Define SVID things.
   __USE_MISC		Define things common to BSD and System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
   __USE_REENTRANT	Define reentrant/thread-safe *_r functions.
   __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.
   __FAVOR_BSD		Favor 4.3BSD things in cases of conflict.

   defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)

   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

/* $XFree86: $ */

/*
 * The "X11 Window System Protocol" standard defines in Appendix A the
 * keysym codes. These 29-bit integer values identify characters or
 * functions associated with each key (e.g., via the visible
 * engraving) of a keyboard layout. This file assigns mnemonic macro
 * names for these keysyms.
 *
 * This file is also compiled (by src/util/makekeys.c in libX11) into
 * hash tables that can be accessed with X11 library functions such as
 * XStringToKeysym() and XKeysymToString().
 *
 * Where a keysym corresponds one-to-one to an ISO 10646 / Unicode
 * character, this is noted in a comment that provides both the U+xxxx
 * Unicode position, as well as the official Unicode name of the
 * character.
 *
 * Where the correspondence is either not one-to-one or semantically
 * unclear, the Unicode position and name are enclosed in
 * parentheses. Such legacy keysyms should be considered deprecated
 * and are not recommended for use in future keyboard mappings.
 *
 * For any future extension of the keysyms with characters already
 * found in ISO 10646 / Unicode, the following algorithm shall be
 * used. The new keysym code position will simply be the character's
 * Unicode number plus 0x01000000. The keysym values in the range
 * 0x01000100 to 0x0110ffff are reserved to represent Unicode
 * characters in the range U+0100 to U+10FFFF.
 * 
 * While most newer Unicode-based X11 clients do already accept
 * Unicode-mapped keysyms in the range 0x01000100 to 0x0110ffff, it
 * will remain necessary for clients -- in the interest of
 * compatibility with existing servers -- to also understand the
 * existing legacy keysym values in the range 0x0100 to 0x20ff.
 *
 * Where several mnemonic names are defined for the same keysym in this
 * file, all but the first one listed should be considered deprecated.
 *
 * Mnemonic names for keysyms are defined in this file with lines
 * that match one of these Perl regular expressions:
 *
 *    /^\#define XK_([a-zA-Z_0-9]+)\s+0x([0-9a-f]+)\s*\/\* U+([0-9A-F]{4,6}) (.*) \*\/\s*$/
 *    /^\#define XK_([a-zA-Z_0-9]+)\s+0x([0-9a-f]+)\s*\/\*\(U+([0-9A-F]{4,6}) (.*)\)\*\/\s*$/
 *    /^\#define XK_([a-zA-Z_0-9]+)\s+0x([0-9a-f]+)\s*(\/\*\s*(.*)\s*\*\/)?\s*$/
 *
 * Before adding new keysyms, please do consider the following: In
 * addition to the keysym names defined in this file, the
 * XStringToKeysym() and XKeysymToString() functions will also handle
 * any keysym string of the form "U0020" to "U007E" and "U00A0" to
 * "U10FFFF" for all possible Unicode characters. In other words,
 * every possible Unicode character has already a keysym string
 * defined algorithmically, even if it is not listed here. Therefore,
 * defining an additional keysym macro is only necessary where a
 * non-hexadecimal mnemonic name is needed, or where the new keysym
 * does not represent any existing Unicode character.
 *
 * When adding new keysyms to this file, do not forget to also update the
 * following:
 *
 *   - the mappings in src/KeyBind.c in the repo
 *     git://anongit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libX11
 *
 *   - the protocol specification in specs/XProtocol/X11.keysyms
 *     in the repo git://anongit.freedesktop.org/xorg/doc/xorg-docs
 *
