C     If the loop range expression is modifed by the loop body, 
C     the modified variable is projected from the region of the loop,
C     we have an exact region which is not correct. 

      PROGRAM LOOP_RANGE
      COMMON N
      REAL A(10)

      DO I = 1, N                                                       0008

C  <A(PHI1)-R-EXACT-{PHI1==I, 1<=I}>

         X = A(I)                                                       0009
