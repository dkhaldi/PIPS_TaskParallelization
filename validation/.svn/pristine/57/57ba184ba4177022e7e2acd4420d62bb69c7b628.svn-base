# Code after privatize_module for module PRIVATIZATION04
#
C     Check that j is not privatized; just likre privatization03.f, but
C     without the initialization. But the lack of initialization makes
C     privatization fine as the output is undefined.

      SUBROUTINE PRIVATIZATION04
      INTEGER A(10)


!$OMP DO PRIVATE(I,J)
      DO I = 1, 10                                                      0008
         J = J+1                                                        0009
