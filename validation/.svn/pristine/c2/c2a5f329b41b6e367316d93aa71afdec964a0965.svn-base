DEAD_CODE_ELIMINATION[dead_code_elimination01] (dead_code_elimination_on_module) [user error] For C code, Dead code elimination should be run with property MEMORY_EFFECTS_ONLY set to FALSE.
For C code, this pass requires that effects are calculated with property MEMORY_EFFECTS_ONLY set to false because we need that the chains include arcs for declarations as these latter are separate statements now.
