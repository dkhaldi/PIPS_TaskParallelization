The C code generated by the Pass instrumentation is not compatible with gcc on chatua (FI).

As a result, the tpips scrit hangs on.

No idea about the C source bug because the error message by gcc seems wrong to me.

No idead why tpips does not complete once gcc detects an error.

Also PIPS_CC should be used instead of gcc...

Different levels of validation should be defined, especially when the generated code should be compiled and executed.
