The equations or the implementation for free in an interprocedural setting give wrong result with the currrent heap model. 

After the first pointer_free(), p1 is undefined, but p2 and p3 might as well be undefined.

Apparently, it is an interprocedural issue. If a free is detected, its effect must be propagated in pt_caller, beyond translation(pt_out).

OK, things might be slightly easier with a list of freed  buckets.
