The formal scope is not exploited for derived entities, dummy or not.

This kind of declaration is not interesting as the derived entities are private to the formal scope. So this kind of declaration is not used.

Note that dummy parameters are also declared in the formal scope, which explaines that foo(int f) {int f;} is correct.

In the PIPS C parser, we have some kind of formal scope for dummy parameters, but not so much for formal parameters, although an empty scope string may be used.

Hard to estimate the necessary work, but the impact should be close to null...
