C  T(S) {S=="Hello World!"}

      SUBROUTINE TYPE23(S)

C     Variable and constant lengths must be taken into account and
C     substring applied... except when you cannot and have to assume
C     it's right

      CHARACTER*(*) S

C  T(S) {S=="Hello World!"}


C     Should not be truncated since the actual lenght of s is unknown
      S = "Hello World!"                                                0010
