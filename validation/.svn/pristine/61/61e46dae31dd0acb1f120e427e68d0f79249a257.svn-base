!     Check replacement of non-affine loop bounds

!     Bug found in BU_INTER_su2cor.f, loop 200, subroutine LOOPS

!     The bug is reproduced with property PARSER_LINEARIZE_LOOP_BOUNDS

      PROGRAM LOOP_BOUND01

      REAL A(16)

      N = 4                                                             0011
!     U_0 is going to be used
      U_0 = 2**N
      DO I = 1, U_0
         A(I) = 0.                                                      0014
      ENDDO

!     Oops, U_0 is going to be re-used
      U_1 = 2**N
      DO I = 1, U_1
