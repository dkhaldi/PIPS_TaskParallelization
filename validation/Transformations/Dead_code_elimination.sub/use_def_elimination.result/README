The summary preconditions are inconsistent with the statement
preconditions because these are computed *intra* procedurally. This is a
known bug/feature of PIPS.

Variable A is an unexpected argument for some statement. This is due to
an approximate fix-point for unstructured.

The preconditions for the never called procedures is now correct,
i.e. non satisfiable. However, they are not propagated because
the interprocedural options are turned down.
