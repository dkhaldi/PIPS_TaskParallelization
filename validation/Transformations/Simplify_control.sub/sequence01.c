// Make sure that useful scoping is not lost: the sequence containing
// "int j;" must stay a block. simplify_control must delete the spurious
// declaration "int j;".

// Apparently, simplify_control fails to clean up the declaration list
// at the block level, which may explain why the empty block is
// preserved. So the current output is correct, but buggy. An internal
// consistency check does detect the issue. Now fixed.
