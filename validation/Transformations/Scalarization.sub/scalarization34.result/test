C     Fifth example, page 18: b(k) is not scalarized by PIPS... because
C     we do not try to scalarize from outside a loop. We would also miss
C     opportunities within a basic block not included in a loop. Or
C     because we do not check that the reference is loop invariant and
C     that the profitability analysis is different, as well as the
C     importation and exportation of the initial and final values, if
C     any
C
C     b(k) is scalarized by the second scalarization algorithm
C     implemented in PIPS
C
C     Also, we do not try to carry a value from one iteration to the next

      SUBROUTINE SCALARIZATION34(A, B, C, D, E, M, N)
      REAL A(N), B(N), C(N), D(N), E(N), M(N)
      B_0 = B(K)

      DO I = 1, 100
         C_0 = C(I)
         IF (M(I).LT.0.) E(I) = C_0
         A(I) = C_0+D(I)
         B_0 = B_0+A(I-1)
      ENDDO
      B(K) = B_0

      PRINT *, B, E

      END
