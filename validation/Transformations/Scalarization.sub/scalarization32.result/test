C     Third example, page 6: the profitability analysis by PIPS is
C     simplistic because the control is not taken into account; also
C     references a(i) and a(i-1) prevent scalarization, which does not
C     matter much here

      SUBROUTINE SCALARIZATION32(A, B, C, D, E, N)
      REAL A(N), B(N), C(N), D(N), E(N)

      DO I = 1, N
         __SCALAR__1 = D(I)
         IF (B(I).LT.0.) THEN
            __SCALAR__0 = A(I)+__SCALAR__1
         ELSE
            __SCALAR__0 = A(I-1)+__SCALAR__1
         ENDIF
         E(I) = __SCALAR__0+A(I)
      ENDDO

      PRINT *, E

      END
