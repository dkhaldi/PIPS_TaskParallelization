csplit must not fail because the scopes of the two C foo functions are different

void foo()
{
   /* This is the first foo function */
   ;
}
extern void foo();
static void foo();
static void foo()
{
   /* This is the second foo function, but it should not conflict with the
        other foo function because they are not in the same file */
   ;
}
