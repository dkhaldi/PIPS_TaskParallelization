linked_regions01: the initial issue from T222

linked_regions02: floating point variable removed and test streamlined

linked_regions03: declarations are moved out of the loop nest

linked_regions04: use array declarations for transformers and preconditions

linked_regions05: square region

linked_regions06: same as linked_regions01, but x1 is declared integer

linked_regions07: constant propagation applied to linked_regions01

linked_regions08: same as linked_regions01, but with property
                  REGIONS_WITH_ARRAY_BOUNDS; no interesting impact at
                  first sight...
