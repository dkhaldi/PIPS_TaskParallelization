The error detection has already beeen programmed, but I do not have the information to decide if it is really an error as in this case or if it is normal as in many other cases.

In this case, an undefined is passed. This should always be forbidden.

In other cases, the effective arguments is a constant such as &i and no equivalent is found for the corresponding formal parameter. There is nothing wrong.
