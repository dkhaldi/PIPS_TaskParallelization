Information about the effects with points-to validation suite:
--------------------------------------------------------------

statement01->statement07 : Basic cases of points-to, computing points-to relations for assignements of type <x = &i>, <x = y>, <x = &a[]> where x is of type pointer or double pointer.

if00, for00, while00, do_while : To illustrate points-to relations in control statements.

struct00->struct04 : To illustrate fields of C stryct type which are pointers.

malloc01, malloc_anywhere, malloc_context_sensitive, malloc_flow_sensitive, malloc_insensitive : To illustrate the use of HEAP_LOCATION  property.

conditional_01 : To treat assignement like x = cond? &i : y.

formal_parameter00 : To illustrate the treatement of formal parameter. 

For compatibility with Effects validation:
