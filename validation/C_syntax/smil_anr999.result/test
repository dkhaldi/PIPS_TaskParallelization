/* These are defined by the user (or the compiler)
   to specify the desired environment:

   __STRICT_ANSI__	ISO Standard C.
   _ISOC99_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C89 from ISO C99.
   _ISOC11_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C99 from ISO C11.
   _POSIX_SOURCE	IEEE Std 1003.1.
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE	If ==1, like _POSIX_SOURCE; if >=2 add IEEE Std 1003.2;
			if >=199309L, add IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993;
			if >=199506L, add IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995;
			if >=200112L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2004
			if >=200809L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2008
   _XOPEN_SOURCE	Includes POSIX and XPG things.  Set to 500 if
			Single Unix conformance is wanted, to 600 for the
			sixth revision, to 700 for the seventh revision.
   _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED XPG things and X/Open Unix extensions.
   _LARGEFILE_SOURCE	Some more functions for correct standard I/O.
   _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE	Additional functionality from LFS for large files.
   _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=N	Select default filesystem interface.
   _BSD_SOURCE		ISO C, POSIX, and 4.3BSD things.
   _SVID_SOURCE		ISO C, POSIX, and SVID things.
   _ATFILE_SOURCE	Additional *at interfaces.
   _GNU_SOURCE		All of the above, plus GNU extensions.
   _DEFAULT_SOURCE	The default set of features (taking precedence over
			__STRICT_ANSI__).
   _REENTRANT		Select additionally reentrant object.
   _THREAD_SAFE		Same as _REENTRANT, often used by other systems.
   _FORTIFY_SOURCE	If set to numeric value > 0 additional security
			measures are defined, according to level.

   The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler, and standards conformance
   options such as `-std=c99', define __STRICT_ANSI__.  If none of
   these are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE is defined, the default is
   to have _SVID_SOURCE, _BSD_SOURCE, and _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to 200809L.  If more than one of these are
   defined, they accumulate.  For example __STRICT_ANSI__,
   _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE together give you ISO C, 1003.1,
   and 1003.2, but nothing else.

   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.

   __USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_BSD		Define 4.3BSD things.
   __USE_SVID		Define SVID things.
   __USE_MISC		Define things common to BSD and System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.

/* The machine-dependent file <bits/typesizes.h> defines __*_T_TYPE
   macros for each of the OS types we define below.  The definitions
   of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
   We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
   variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, always long long
	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
   and int is always 32 bits.  */

   The OPTS string is a list of characters which are recognized option
   letters, optionally followed by colons, specifying that that letter
   takes an argument, to be placed in `optarg'.

   If a letter in OPTS is followed by two colons, its argument is
   optional.  This behavior is specific to the GNU `getopt'.

   The argument `--' causes premature termination of argument
   scanning, explicitly telling `getopt' that there are no more
   options.

   If OPTS begins with `--', then non-option arguments are treated as
   arguments to the option '\0'.  This behavior is specific to the GNU
   `getopt'.  */

/* PY_FORMAT_SIZE_T is a platform-specific modifier for use in a printf

 * C99 introduced "z" for this purpose, but not all platforms support that;
 * e.g., MS compilers use "I" instead.
 *
 * These "high level" Python format functions interpret "z" correctly on

 * the platform C requires to convert a size_t/Py_ssize_t argument):
 *
 *     PyString_FromFormat
 *     PyErr_Format
 *     PyString_FromFormatV
 *
 * Lower-level uses require that you interpolate the correct format modifier
 * yourself (e.g., calling printf, fprintf, sprintf, PyOS_snprintf); for
 * example,
 *
 *     Py_ssize_t index;
 *     fprintf(stderr, "index %" PY_FORMAT_SIZE_T "d sucks\n", index);
 *
 * That will expand to %ld, or %Id, or to something else correct for a
 * Py_ssize_t on the platform.
 */
/* PY_FORMAT_LONG_LONG is analogous to PY_FORMAT_SIZE_T above, but for
 * the long long type instead of the size_t type.  It's only available
 * when HAVE_LONG_LONG is defined. The "high level" Python format
 * functions listed above will interpret "lld" or "llu" correctly on
 * all platforms.

/* Py_LOCAL can be used instead of static to get the fastest possible calling
 * convention for functions that are local to a given module.
 *
 * Py_LOCAL_INLINE does the same thing, and also explicitly requests inlining,
 * for platforms that support that.
 *
 * If PY_LOCAL_AGGRESSIVE is defined before python.h is included, more
 * "aggressive" inlining/optimizaion is enabled for the entire module.  This
 * may lead to code bloat, and may slow things down for those reasons.  It may
 * also lead to errors, if the code relies on pointer aliasing.  Use with
 * care.
 *
 * NOTE: You can only use this for functions that are entirely local to a
 * module; functions that are exported via method tables, callbacks, etc,
 * should keep using static.
 */
/* Py_MEMCPY can be used instead of memcpy in cases where the copied blocks
 * are often very short.  While most platforms have highly optimized code for
 * large transfers, the setup costs for memcpy are often quite high.  MEMCPY
 * solves this by doing short copies "in line".

/* NOTE: Because of the special way this file is used by <math.h>, this
   file must NOT be protected from multiple inclusion as header files
   usually are.

   This file provides prototype declarations for the math functions.
   Most functions are declared using the macro:

   __MATHCALL (NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This means there is a function `NAME' returning `double' and a function
   `NAMEf' returning `float'.  Each place `_Mdouble_' appears in the
   prototype, that is actually `double' in the prototype for `NAME' and
   `float' in the prototype for `NAMEf'.  Reentrant variant functions are
   called `NAME_r' and `NAMEf_r'.

   Functions returning other types like `int' are declared using the macro:

   __MATHDECL (TYPE, NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This is just like __MATHCALL but for a function returning `TYPE'
   instead of `_Mdouble_'.  In all of these cases, there is still
   both a `NAME' and a `NAMEf' that takes `float' arguments.

   Note that there must be no whitespace before the argument passed for
   NAME, to make token pasting work with -traditional.  */

/* NOTE: Because of the special way this file is used by <math.h>, this
   file must NOT be protected from multiple inclusion as header files
   usually are.

   This file provides prototype declarations for the math functions.
   Most functions are declared using the macro:

   __MATHCALL (NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This means there is a function `NAME' returning `double' and a function
   `NAMEf' returning `float'.  Each place `_Mdouble_' appears in the
   prototype, that is actually `double' in the prototype for `NAME' and
   `float' in the prototype for `NAMEf'.  Reentrant variant functions are
   called `NAME_r' and `NAMEf_r'.

   Functions returning other types like `int' are declared using the macro:

   __MATHDECL (TYPE, NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This is just like __MATHCALL but for a function returning `TYPE'
   instead of `_Mdouble_'.  In all of these cases, there is still
   both a `NAME' and a `NAMEf' that takes `float' arguments.

   Note that there must be no whitespace before the argument passed for
   NAME, to make token pasting work with -traditional.  */

/* NOTE: Because of the special way this file is used by <math.h>, this
   file must NOT be protected from multiple inclusion as header files
   usually are.

   This file provides prototype declarations for the math functions.
   Most functions are declared using the macro:

   __MATHCALL (NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This means there is a function `NAME' returning `double' and a function
   `NAMEf' returning `float'.  Each place `_Mdouble_' appears in the
   prototype, that is actually `double' in the prototype for `NAME' and
   `float' in the prototype for `NAMEf'.  Reentrant variant functions are
   called `NAME_r' and `NAMEf_r'.

   Functions returning other types like `int' are declared using the macro:

   __MATHDECL (TYPE, NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This is just like __MATHCALL but for a function returning `TYPE'
   instead of `_Mdouble_'.  In all of these cases, there is still
   both a `NAME' and a `NAMEf' that takes `float' arguments.

   Note that there must be no whitespace before the argument passed for
   NAME, to make token pasting work with -traditional.  */

/* The PyMem_ family:  low-level memory allocation interfaces.
   See objimpl.h for the PyObject_ memory family.
*/
/* BEWARE:

   Each interface exports both functions and macros.  Extension modules should
   use the functions, to ensure binary compatibility across Python versions.
   Because the Python implementation is free to change internal details, and
   the macros may (or may not) expose details for speed, if you do use the
   macros you must recompile your extensions with each Python release.

   Never mix calls to PyMem_ with calls to the platform malloc/realloc/
   calloc/free.  For example, on Windows different DLLs may end up using
   different heaps, and if you use PyMem_Malloc you'll get the memory from the
   heap used by the Python DLL; it could be a disaster if you free()'ed that
   directly in your own extension.  Using PyMem_Free instead ensures Python
   can return the memory to the proper heap.  As another example, in
   PYMALLOC_DEBUG mode, Python wraps all calls to all PyMem_ and PyObject_
   memory functions in special debugging wrappers that add additional
   debugging info to dynamic memory blocks.  The system routines have no idea
   what to do with that stuff, and the Python wrappers have no idea what to do

/* Object and type object interface */

/*
Objects are structures allocated on the heap.  Special rules apply to
the use of objects to ensure they are properly garbage-collected.
Objects are never allocated statically or on the stack; they must be
accessed through special macros and functions only.  (Type objects are
exceptions to the first rule; the standard types are represented by
statically initialized type objects, although work on type/class unification
for Python 2.2 made it possible to have heap-allocated type objects too).

An object has a 'reference count' that is increased or decreased when a
pointer to the object is copied or deleted; when the reference count
reaches zero there are no references to the object left and it can be
removed from the heap.

An object has a 'type' that determines what it represents and what kind
of data it contains.  An object's type is fixed when it is created.
Types themselves are represented as objects; an object contains a
pointer to the corresponding type object.  The type itself has a type
pointer pointing to the object representing the type 'type', which
contains a pointer to itself!).

Objects do not float around in memory; once allocated an object keeps
the same size and address.  Objects that must hold variable-size data
can contain pointers to variable-size parts of the object.  Not all
objects of the same type have the same size; but the size cannot change
after allocation.  (These restrictions are made so a reference to an
object can be simply a pointer -- moving an object would require
updating all the pointers, and changing an object's size would require
moving it if there was another object right next to it.)

Objects are always accessed through pointers of the type 'PyObject *'.
The type 'PyObject' is a structure that only contains the reference count
and the type pointer.  The actual memory allocated for an object
contains other data that can only be accessed after casting the pointer
to a pointer to a longer structure type.  This longer type must start
with the reference count and type fields; the macro PyObject_HEAD should be
used for this (to accommodate for future changes).  The implementation
of a particular object type can cast the object pointer to the proper
type and back.

A standard interface exists for objects that contain an array of items
whose size is determined when the object is allocated.
*/

/* Py_DEBUG implies Py_TRACE_REFS. */




/* Py_TRACE_REFS implies Py_REF_DEBUG. */
/* PyObject_HEAD defines the initial segment of every PyObject. */
/* PyObject_VAR_HEAD defines the initial segment of all variable-size
 * container objects.  These end with a declaration of an array with 1
 * element, but enough space is malloc'ed so that the array actually
 * has room for ob_size elements.  Note that ob_size is an element count,
 * not necessarily a byte count.
 */





/* Nothing is actually declared to be a PyObject, but every pointer to
 * a Python object can be cast to a PyObject*.  This is inheritance built
 * by hand.  Similarly every pointer to a variable-size Python object can,

this type.  The Py_DECREF() macro uses the tp_dealloc method without
checking for a nil pointer; it should always be implemented except if
the implementation can guarantee that the reference count will never
reach zero (e.g., for statically allocated type objects).

NB: the methods for certain type groups are now contained in separate
method blocks.

`Type flags (tp_flags)

These flags are used to extend the type structure in a backwards-compatible
fashion. Extensions can use the flags to indicate (and test) when a given
type structure contains a new feature. The Python core will use these when
introducing new functionality between major revisions (to avoid mid-version
changes in the PYTHON_API_VERSION).

Arbitration of the flag bit positions will need to be coordinated among
all extension writers who publically release their extensions (this will
be fewer than you might expect!)..

Python 1.5.2 introduced the bf_getcharbuffer slot into PyBufferProcs.

Type definitions should use Py_TPFLAGS_DEFAULT for their tp_flags value.

Code can use PyType_HasFeature(type_ob, flag_value) to test whether the
given type object has a specified feature.

NOTE: when building the core, Py_TPFLAGS_DEFAULT includes
Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VERSION_TAG; outside the core, it doesn't.  This is so
that extensions that modify tp_dict of their own types directly don't
break, since this was allowed in 2.5.  In 3.0 they will have to
manually remove this flag though!

/*
The macros Py_INCREF(op) and Py_DECREF(op) are used to increment or decrement
reference counts.  Py_DECREF calls the object's deallocator function when
the refcount falls to 0; for
objects that don't contain references to other objects or heap memory
this can be the standard function free().  Both macros can be used
wherever a void expression is allowed.  The argument must not be a
NULL pointer.  If it may be NULL, use Py_XINCREF/Py_XDECREF instead.
The macro _Py_NewReference(op) initialize reference counts to 1, and
in special builds (Py_REF_DEBUG, Py_TRACE_REFS) performs additional
bookkeeping appropriate to the special build.

We assume that the reference count field can never overflow; this can
be proven when the size of the field is the same as the pointer size, so
we ignore the possibility.  Provided a C int is at least 32 bits (which
is implicitly assumed in many parts of this code), that's enough for
about 2**31 references to an object.

XXX The following became out of date in Python 2.2, but I'm not sure
XXX what the full truth is now.  Certainly, heap-allocated type objects
XXX can and should be deallocated.
Type objects should never be deallocated; the type pointer in an object
is not considered to be a reference to the type object, to save
complications in the deallocation function.  (This is actually a
decision that's up to the implementer of each new type so if you want,
you can count such references to the type object.)

*** WARNING*** The Py_DECREF macro must have a side-effect-free argument
since it may evaluate its argument multiple times.  (The alternative
would be to mace it a proper function or assign it to a global temporary
variable first, both of which are slower; and in a multi-threaded
environment the global variable trick is not safe.)

/*
More conventions
================

Argument Checking
-----------------

Functions that take objects as arguments normally don't check for nil
arguments, but they do check the type of the argument, and return an
error if the function doesn't apply to the type.

Failure Modes
-------------

Functions may fail for a variety of reasons, including running out of
memory.  This is communicated to the caller in two ways: an error string
is set (see errors.h), and the function result differs: functions that
normally return a pointer return NULL for failure, functions returning
an integer return -1 (which could be a legal return value too!), and
other functions return 0 for success and -1 for failure.
Callers should always check for errors before using the result.  If
an error was set, the caller must either explicitly clear it, or pass
the error on to its caller.

Reference Counts
----------------

It takes a while to get used to the proper usage of reference counts.

Functions that create an object set the reference count to 1; such new
objects must be stored somewhere or destroyed again with Py_DECREF().
Some functions that 'store' objects, such as PyTuple_SetItem() and
PyList_SetItem(),
don't increment the reference count of the object, since the most
frequent use is to store a fresh object.  Functions that 'retrieve'
objects, such as PyTuple_GetItem() and PyDict_GetItemString(), also
don't increment
the reference count, since most frequently the object is only looked at
quickly.  Thus, to retrieve an object and store it again, the caller
must call Py_INCREF() explicitly.

NOTE: functions that 'consume' a reference count, like
PyList_SetItem(), consume the reference even if the object wasn't
successfully stored, to simplify error handling.

It seems attractive to make other functions that take an object as
argument consume a reference count; however, this may quickly get
confusing (even the current practice is already confusing).  Consider
it carefully, it may save lots of calls to Py_INCREF() and Py_DECREF() at
times.
*/


/* Trashcan mechanism, thanks to Christian Tismer.

When deallocating a container object, it's possible to trigger an unbounded
chain of deallocations, as each Py_DECREF in turn drops the refcount on "the
next" object in the chain to 0.  This can easily lead to stack faults, and
especially in threads (which typically have less stack space to work with).

A container object that participates in cyclic gc can avoid this by
bracketing the body of its tp_dealloc function with a pair of macros:

static void
mytype_dealloc(mytype *p)
{
    ... declarations go here ...

    PyObject_GC_UnTrack(p);        // must untrack first
    Py_TRASHCAN_SAFE_BEGIN(p)
    ... The body of the deallocator goes here, including all calls ...
    ... to Py_DECREF on contained objects.                         ...
    Py_TRASHCAN_SAFE_END(p)
}

CAUTION:  Never return from the middle of the body!  If the body needs to
"get out early", put a label immediately before the Py_TRASHCAN_SAFE_END
call, and goto it.  Else the call-depth counter (see below) will stay
above 0 forever, and the trashcan will never get emptied.

How it works:  The BEGIN macro increments a call-depth counter.  So long
as this counter is small, the body of the deallocator is run directly without
further ado.  But if the counter gets large, it instead adds p to a list of
objects to be deallocated later, skips the body of the deallocator, and
resumes execution after the END macro.  The tp_dealloc routine then returns
without deallocating anything (and so unbounded call-stack depth is avoided).

When the call stack finishes unwinding again, code generated by the END macro
notices this, and calls another routine to deallocate all the objects that
may have been added to the list of deferred deallocations.  In effect, a
chain of N deallocations is broken into N / PyTrash_UNWIND_LEVEL pieces,
with the call stack never exceeding a depth of PyTrash_UNWIND_LEVEL.

/*
Functions and macros for modules that implement new object types.

 - PyObject_New(type, typeobj) allocates memory for a new object of the given
   type, and initializes part of it.  'type' must be the C structure type used
   to represent the object, and 'typeobj' the address of the corresponding
   type object.  Reference count and type pointer are filled in; the rest of
   the bytes of the object are *undefined*!  The resulting expression type is
   'type *'.  The size of the object is determined by the tp_basicsize field
   of the type object.

 - PyObject_NewVar(type, typeobj, n) is similar but allocates a variable-size
   object with room for n items.  In addition to the refcount and type pointer
   fields, this also fills in the ob_size field.

 - PyObject_Del(op) releases the memory allocated for an object.  It does not
   run a destructor -- it only frees the memory.  PyObject_Free is identical.

 - PyObject_Init(op, typeobj) and PyObject_InitVar(op, typeobj, n) don't
   allocate memory.  Instead of a 'type' parameter, they take a pointer to a
   new object (allocated by an arbitrary allocator), and initialize its object
   header fields.

Note that objects created with PyObject_{New, NewVar} are allocated using the
specialized Python allocator (implemented in obmalloc.c), if WITH_PYMALLOC is
enabled.  In addition, a special debugging allocator is used if PYMALLOC_DEBUG
is also #defined.

In case a specific form of memory management is needed (for example, if you
must use the platform malloc heap(s), or shared memory, or C++ local storage or
operator new), you must first allocate the object with your custom allocator,
then pass its pointer to PyObject_{Init, InitVar} for filling in its Python-
specific fields:  reference count, type pointer, possibly others.  You should
be aware that Python no control over these objects because they don't
cooperate with the Python memory manager.  Such objects may not be eligible
for automatic garbage collection and you have to make sure that they are
released accordingly whenever their destructor gets called (cf. the specific
form of memory management you're using).

Unless you have specific memory management requirements, use
PyObject_{New, NewVar, Del}.
*/

/*
 * Raw object memory interface
 * ===========================
 */

/* Functions to call the same malloc/realloc/free as used by Python's
   object allocator.  If WITH_PYMALLOC is enabled, these may differ from
   the platform malloc/realloc/free.  The Python object allocator is
   designed for fast, cache-conscious allocation of many "small" objects,
   and with low hidden memory overhead.

   PyObject_Malloc(0) returns a unique non-NULL pointer if possible.

   PyObject_Realloc(NULL, n) acts like PyObject_Malloc(n).
   PyObject_Realloc(p != NULL, 0) does not return  NULL, or free the memory
   at p.

   Returned pointers must be checked for NULL explicitly; no action is
   performed on failure other than to return NULL (no warning it printed, no
   exception is set, etc).

   For allocating objects, use PyObject_{New, NewVar} instead whenever
   possible.  The PyObject_{Malloc, Realloc, Free} family is exposed
   so that you can exploit Python's small-block allocator for non-object
   uses.  If you must use these routines to allocate object memory, make sure
   the object gets initialized via PyObject_{Init, InitVar} after obtaining
   the raw memory.

   ensure that pointer fields at the end of the object are correctly aligned

   to contain those mappings which map characters to different code

an object for string-ness, and to get the

       (if there is one).
     - CObjects will be removed in Python 2.9 (if there is one).

   Additionally, for the Python 3.x series:
     - CObjects were marked Deprecated in Python 3.1.
     - CObjects will be removed in Python 3.2.

   You should switch all use of CObjects to capsules.  Capsules
   have a safer and more consistent API.  For more information,
   see Include/pycapsule.h, or read the "Capsules" topic in
   the "Python/C API Reference Manual".

   Python 2.7 no longer uses CObjects itself; all objects which
   were formerly CObjects are now capsules.  Note that this change
   does not by itself break binary compatibility with extensions
   built for previous versions of Python--PyCObject_AsVoidPtr()
   has been changed to also understand capsules.

   18-Jan-1997	GvR	1007	string interning and other speedups

   11-Oct-1996	GvR	renamed Py_Ellipses to Py_Ellipsis :-(

   30-Jul-1996	GvR	Slice and ellipses syntax added

   23-Jul-1996	GvR	For 1.4 -- better safe than sorry this time :-)

   7-Nov-1995	GvR	Keyword arguments (should've been done at 1.3 :-( )

   10-Jan-1995	GvR	Renamed globals to new naming scheme

   9-Jan-1995	GvR	Initial version (incompatible with older API)

/* Interface for threads.

   A module that plans to do a blocking system call (or something else
   that lasts a long time and doesn't touch Python data) can allow other
   threads to run as follows:

    ...preparations here...
    Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS
    ...blocking system call here...
    Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS
    ...interpret result here...

   The Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS/Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS pair expands to a
   {}-surrounded block.
   To leave the block in the middle (e.g., with return), you must insert
   a line containing Py_BLOCK_THREADS before the return, e.g.

    if (...premature_exit...) {
        Py_BLOCK_THREADS
        PyErr_SetFromErrno(PyExc_IOError);
        return NULL;
    }

   An alternative is:

    Py_BLOCK_THREADS
    if (...premature_exit...) {
        PyErr_SetFromErrno(PyExc_IOError);
        return NULL;
    }
    Py_UNBLOCK_THREADS

   For convenience, that the value of 'errno' is restored across
   Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS and Py_BLOCK_THREADS.

   WARNING: NEVER NEST CALLS TO Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS AND
   Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS!!!

   The function PyEval_InitThreads() should be called only from
   initthread() in "threadmodule.c".

   Note that not yet all candidates have been converted to use this
   mechanism!

   PROPOSAL: A Generic Python Object Interface for Python C Modules

Problem

  Python modules written in C that must access Python objects must do
  so through routines whose interfaces are described by a set of
  include files.  Unfortunately, these routines vary according to the
  object accessed.  To use these routines, the C programmer must check
  the type of the object being used and must call a routine based on
  the object type.  For example, to access an element of a sequence,
  the programmer must determine whether the sequence is a list or a
  tuple:

    if(is_tupleobject(o))
      e=gettupleitem(o,i)
    else if(is_listitem(o))
      e=getlistitem(o,i)

  If the programmer wants to get an item from another type of object
  that provides sequence behavior, there is no clear way to do it
  correctly.

  The persistent programmer may peruse object.h and find that the
  _typeobject structure provides a means of invoking up to (currently
  about) 41 special operators.  So, for example, a routine can get an
  item from any object that provides sequence behavior. However, to
  use this mechanism, the programmer must make their code dependent on
  the current Python implementation.

  Also, certain semantics, especially memory management semantics, may
  differ by the type of object being used.  Unfortunately, these
  semantics are not clearly described in the current include files.
  An abstract interface providing more consistent semantics is needed.

Proposal

  I propose the creation of a standard interface (with an associated
  library of routines and/or macros) for generically obtaining the
  services of Python objects.  This proposal can be viewed as one
  components of a Python C interface consisting of several components.

  From the viewpoint of C access to Python services, we have (as
  suggested by Guido in off-line discussions):

  - "Very high level layer": two or three functions that let you exec or
    eval arbitrary Python code given as a string in a module whose name is
    given, passing C values in and getting C values out using
    mkvalue/getargs style format strings.  This does not require the user
    to declare any variables of type "PyObject *".  This should be enough
    to write a simple application that gets Python code from the user,
    execs it, and returns the output or errors.  (Error handling must also
    be part of this API.)

  - "Abstract objects layer": which is the subject of this proposal.
    It has many functions operating on objects, and lest you do many
    things from C that you can also write in Python, without going
    through the Python parser.

  - "Concrete objects layer": This is the public type-dependent
    interface provided by the standard built-in types, such as floats,
    strings, and lists.  This interface exists and is currently
    documented by the collection of include files provided with the
    Python distributions.

  From the point of view of Python accessing services provided by C
  modules:

  - "Python module interface": this interface consist of the basic
    routines used to define modules and their members.  Most of the
    current extensions-writing guide deals with this interface.

  - "Built-in object interface": this is the interface that a new
    built-in type must provide and the mechanisms and rules that a
    developer of a new built-in type must use and follow.

  This proposal is a "first-cut" that is intended to spur
  discussion. See especially the lists of notes.

  The Python C object interface will provide four protocols: object,
  numeric, sequence, and mapping.  Each protocol consists of a
  collection of related operations.  If an operation that is not
  provided by a particular type is invoked, then a standard exception,
  NotImplementedError is raised with a operation name as an argument.
  In addition, for convenience this interface defines a set of
  constructors for building objects of built-in types.  This is needed
  so new objects can be returned from C functions that otherwise treat
  objects generically.

Memory Management

  For all of the functions described in this proposal, if a function
  retains a reference to a Python object passed as an argument, then the
  function will increase the reference count of the object.  It is
  unnecessary for the caller to increase the reference count of an
  argument in anticipation of the object's retention.

  All Python objects returned from functions should be treated as new
  objects.  Functions that return objects assume that the caller will
  retain a reference and the reference count of the object has already
  been incremented to account for this fact.  A caller that does not
  retain a reference to an object that is returned from a function
  must decrement the reference count of the object (using
  DECREF(object)) to prevent memory leaks.

  Note that the behavior mentioned here is different from the current
  behavior for some objects (e.g. lists and tuples) when certain
  type-specific routines are called directly (e.g. setlistitem).  The
  proposed abstraction layer will provide a consistent memory
  management interface, correcting for inconsistent behavior for some
  built-in types.

/*
 *       Define macros for handling SIGFPE.
 *       Lee Busby, LLNL, November, 1996
 *       busby1@llnl.gov
 * 
 *********************************************
 * Overview of the system for handling SIGFPE:
 * 
 * This file (Include/pyfpe.h) defines a couple of "wrapper" macros for
 * insertion into your Python C code of choice. Their proper use is
 * discussed below. The file Python/pyfpe.c defines a pair of global
 * variables PyFPE_jbuf and PyFPE_counter which are used by the signal
 * handler for SIGFPE to decide if a particular exception was protected
 * by the macros. The signal handler itself, and code for enabling the
 * generation of SIGFPE in the first place, is in a (new) Python module
 * named fpectl. This module is standard in every respect. It can be loaded
 * either statically or dynamically as you choose, and like any other
 * Python module, has no effect until you import it.
 * 
 * In the general case, there are three steps toward handling SIGFPE in any
 * Python code:
 * 
 * 1) Add the *_PROTECT macros to your C code as required to protect
 *    dangerous floating point sections.
 * 
 * 2) Turn on the inclusion of the code by adding the ``--with-fpectl''
 *    flag at the time you run configure.  If the fpectl or other modules
 *    which use the *_PROTECT macros are to be dynamically loaded, be
 *    sure they are compiled with WANT_SIGFPE_HANDLER defined.
 * 
 * 3) When python is built and running, import fpectl, and execute
 *    fpectl.turnon_sigfpe(). This sets up the signal handler and enables
 *    generation of SIGFPE whenever an exception occurs. From this point
 *    on, any properly trapped SIGFPE should result in the Python
 *    FloatingPointError exception.
 * 
 * Step 1 has been done already for the Python kernel code, and should be
 * done soon for the NumPy array package.  Step 2 is usually done once at
 * python install time. Python's behavior with respect to SIGFPE is not
 * changed unless you also do step 3. Thus you can control this new
 * facility at compile time, or run time, or both.
 * 
 ******************************** 
 * Using the macros in your code:
 * 
 * static PyObject *foobar(PyObject *self,PyObject *args)
 * {
 *     ....
 *     PyFPE_START_PROTECT("Error in foobar", return 0)
 *     result = dangerous_op(somearg1, somearg2, ...);
 *     PyFPE_END_PROTECT(result)
 *     ....
 * }
 * 
 * If a floating point error occurs in dangerous_op, foobar returns 0 (NULL),
 * after setting the associated value of the FloatingPointError exception to
 * "Error in foobar". ``Dangerous_op'' can be a single operation, or a block
 * of code, function calls, or any combination, so long as no alternate
 * return is possible before the PyFPE_END_PROTECT macro is reached.
 * 
 * The macros can only be used in a function context where an error return
 * can be recognized as signaling a Python exception. (Generally, most
 * functions that return a PyObject * will qualify.)
 * 
 * Guido's original design suggestion for PyFPE_START_PROTECT and
 * PyFPE_END_PROTECT had them open and close a local block, with a locally
 * defined jmp_buf and jmp_buf pointer. This would allow recursive nesting
 * of the macros. The Ansi C standard makes it clear that such local
 * variables need to be declared with the "volatile" type qualifier to keep
 * setjmp from corrupting their values. Some current implementations seem
 * to be more restrictive. For example, the HPUX man page for setjmp says
 * 
 *   Upon the return from a setjmp() call caused by a longjmp(), the
 *   values of any non-static local variables belonging to the routine
 *   from which setjmp() was called are undefined. Code which depends on
 *   such values is not guaranteed to be portable.
 * 
 * I therefore decided on a more limited form of nesting, using a counter
 * variable (PyFPE_counter) to keep track of any recursion.  If an exception
 * occurs in an ``inner'' pair of macros, the return will apparently
 * come from the outermost level.
 *
