Initial source code

void minmax()
{
   /*hehe guess what, pips accept this ! */
   int a;
   /* easy */
   a = MIN(1, 2);
   /* harder, but not that much with preconditions and
          expression_to_transformer() */
   a = MIN(0, a);
}

MIN and/or MAX should have disapeared

void minmax()
{
   /*hehe guess what, pips accept this ! */
   int a;
   /* easy */
   a = 1;
   /* harder, but not that much with preconditions and
          expression_to_transformer() */
   a = 0;
}
