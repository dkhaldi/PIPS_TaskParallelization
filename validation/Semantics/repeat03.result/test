Select some options to deal with the C Language:
Parse as C:
Prettyprint the source as C, of course
Do not display original number lines as comment:
If possible, transform simple for-loops into do-loop à la Fortran, simpler to analyze:
Desugaring other for-loops into plain while-loops fot the time we improve semantics ameliorations in PIPS:
Select the most precise analysis:
Compute the intraprocedural preconditions at the same time as
transformers and use them to improve the accuracy of expression
and statement transformers:
Try to restructure the code for more precision:
Privatize scalar variables on all the modules of the program:
Ask for some statistics about the job to be done:
Ask for the parallelization of all the modules of the program with OpenMP getimage:
void getimage(char *filename)
{
   unsigned char c;
   FILE *fp;

   fp = fopen(filename, "r");
   do {
      while ((c = fgetc(fp))!='\n')
         ;
   }
   while ((c = fgetc(fp))=='#');
   /* Skip comment lines */
   
   fclose(fp);
}
void getimage(char *filename)
{
   unsigned char c;
   FILE *fp;

   fp = fopen(filename, "r");
   do {
      while ((c = fgetc(fp))!='\n')
         ;
   }
   while ((c = fgetc(fp))=='#');
   /* Skip comment lines */
   
   fclose(fp);
}
Regenerate the sources from the PIPS transformed code:
