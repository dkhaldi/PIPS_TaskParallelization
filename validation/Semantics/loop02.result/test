      PROGRAM LOOP02

C     Bug on transformer: you cannot say anything about T's value after
C     the loops. The loops seem to be supposed always entered and T's
C     value to always be increased because the transformer syntactically
C     associated to the loop is semantically associated to the loop
C     body.
