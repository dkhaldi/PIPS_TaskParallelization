C  T() {}

      PROGRAM TYPE24

C     No substring operator is applied interprocedurally although s1 and
C     s2 should receive different values

      CHARACTER*20 S1
      CHARACTER*2 S2

C  T(S1) {S1=="Hello World!"}


      CALL FOO(S1)                                                      0009

C  T(S2) {S2=="Hello World!"}

      CALL FOO(S2)                                                      0010

C  T() {}


      PRINT *, S1, S2                                                   0012

      END

C  T(S) {S=="Hello World!"}


      SUBROUTINE FOO(S)

C     Variable and constant lengths must be taken into account and
C     substring applied... except when you cannot and have to assume
C     that the assignment is legal

      CHARACTER*(*) S

C  T(S) {S=="Hello World!"}


C     Should not be truncated since the actual lenght of s is unknown
      S = "Hello World!"                                                0011
