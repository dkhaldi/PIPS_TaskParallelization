      PROGRAM CALLABSVAL

C     BUG: RESULTS ARE BETTER IN ABSVAL THAN IN CALLABSVAL BECAUSE
C     THE ABSVAL TRANSFORMER DOES NOT TAKE THE TEST CONDITION INTO ACCOUNT

C     NOTE ALSO THAT PRECONDITIONS IN THE TEST BRANCHES ARE NOT SYMMETRICAL
C     BECAUSE 0 BELONGS TO THE [-1..1] INTERVAL AND BECAUSE THE CONDITION
C     .LT. IS MORE PRECISE WHEN N IS NEGATIVE

      I = 1                                                             0001
      CALL ABSVAL(I, IABS)                                              0002
      I = -1                                                            0003
      CALL ABSVAL(I, IABS)                                              0004
      END
