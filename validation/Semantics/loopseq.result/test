--- Preconditions for LOOPSEQ

C  P() {}

      PROGRAM LOOPSEQ

C     Check exit condition from first loop onto second loop

C     Bug: the second loop on I is not properly analyzed.
C     It cannot be shown to be dead code

      REAL T(100)

C  P() {}


      IF (N.GE.1) THEN                                                  0012

C  P() {1<=N}


         DO I = 1, N                                                    0014

C  P(I) {1<=I, I<=N, 1<=N}

            T(I) = 0.                                                   0015
         ENDDO

C  P(I) {I==N+1, 2<=I}


C     This loops leads to i <= i <= n and fortunately the
C     left part disappears as a trivial constraint. But it should
C     never have been built in the first place!

C     Bug fixed on June 22, 1997

         DO I = I, N                                                    0024

C  P() {0==-1}

            T(I) = 0.                                                   0025
         ENDDO

C  P(I) {I==N+1, 2<=I}


         PRINT *, I                                                     0028
