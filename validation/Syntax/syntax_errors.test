# The environment variable overrides the property
#PIPS_CHECK_FORTRAN="NO"
#export PIPS_CHECK_FORTRAN

# The purpose was to make sure that the precompilation mecanism works
# for Fortran code and that errors are detected as expected. Because
# the workspace creation fails, the key user warning "Fortran syntax
# errors in file ./syntax_errors.f!" is lost because it is stored in
# file Warnings within a directory that is instantly destroyed.

# So the only way to get the useful message is to search the string
# "Fortran syntax errors in source file" in the process output

# Portable because the message checked is generated by PIPS when the
# result of the external Fortran compiler is checked.
