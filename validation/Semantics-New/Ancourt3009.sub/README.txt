Set of tspear test cases prepared by Corinne Ancourt, completed with
simpler test cases for array and pointer and constant C string
analysis, for global variable analysis, and for intrinsics (memcpy and
scanf).

Use of malloc among Corinne's cases: 

 * 03: array of integers

 * 05: struct

 * 08: two structs

 * 10: two substructs

 * 11: two structs

Array analysis:

 * array01: aliasing

 * array02: initialization of array elements in "init" function

 * array03: update of array elements in "update" function

 * array04: initialization of elements of an array of struct

 * array05: update of elements of an array of struct

 * array06: initialization of element in a struct array field, within
   an array of structs
