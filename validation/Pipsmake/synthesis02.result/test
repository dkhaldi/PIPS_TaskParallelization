      PROGRAM SYNTHESIS02

C     Goal: debug the code synthesis in initializer()
C     Check that a call graph of this routine can be obtained
C     by automatically generating source code for FOO and BAR

      COMPLEX C

      CHARACTER*80 S
c      parameter (lng=10)
C      character*lng s2

      CALL FOO(X, I, C, S)                                              0013

c      c = bar(i, s2)
      C = BAR(I, J, K)                                                  0016
