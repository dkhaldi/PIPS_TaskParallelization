Select some options to deal with the C Language:
Parse as C:
Prettyprint the source as C, of course
Do not display original number lines as comment:
If possible, transform simple for-loops into do-loop à la Fortran, simpler to analyze:
Desugaring other for-loops into plain while-loops fot the time we improve semantics ameliorations in PIPS:
Select the most precise analyses:
Compute the intraprocedural preconditions at the same time as
transformers and use them to improve the accuracy of expression
and statement transformers:
Try to restructure the code for more precision:
Check the proper effects
void while01(int n)
{
   int i, j;
   float x[100];
//             <    is read   >: i n

   while (i<n) {
//             <    is written>: j
      for(j = 0; j <= 99; j += 1)
//             <    is read   >: j
//             <    is written>: x[j]
         x[j] = 0.;
//             <    is read   >: i
//             <    is written>: i
      i++;
   }
}
Privatize scalar variables
Ask for some statistics about the job to be done:
Ask for the parallelization of "while01"
void while01(int n)
{
   int i, j;
   float x[100];

   while (i<n) {
#pragma omp parallel for 
      for(j = 0; j <= 99; j += 1)
         x[j] = 0.;
      i++;
   }
}
