/* Try casts
 *
 * We have a problem because we want all points-to information to be
 * proprely typed. The bucket allocated for "toto" is identified as an
 * array of double elements. But "toto" is a "void *" and won't carry
 * the previous information explicitly. Furthermore, the bucket is
 * casted as a 2-D array of double elements.
 *
 * We could refuse the cast and return an anywhere cell for toto. Or
 * we should check the compatibility between the cast type and the
 * type of the cell pointed to by "toto".
