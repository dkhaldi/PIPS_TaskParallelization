Select the most precise analysis:
Compute the intraprocedural preconditions at the same time as
transformers and use them to improve the accuracy of expression
and statement transformers:
Try to restructure the code for more precision:
Privatize scalar variables on all the modules of the program:
Ask for some statistics about the job to be done:
Ask for the parallelization of all the modules of the program with OpenMP output:
enum {N=9};

typedef struct {
   float re;
   float im;
} complex;

complex imagein[N][N];

extern int main(int argc, char *argv[]);
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
   int i, j, k;

   return 0;
}
