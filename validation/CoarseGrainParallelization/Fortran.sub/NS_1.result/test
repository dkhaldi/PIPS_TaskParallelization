Select the most precise analysis:
Compute the intraprocedural preconditions at the same time as
transformers and use them to improve the accuracy of expression
and statement transformers:
Try to restructure the code for more precision:
Privatize variables on all the modules of the program:
Ask for some statistics about the job to be done:
Ask for the parallelization of all the modules of the program with OpenMP output:
       PROGRAM NS
       PARAMETER (NVAR=3,NXM=2000,NYM=2000)
       REAL PHI(NVAR,NXM,NYM)
      NX = 101                                                          0004
      NY = 101                                                          0005

!     The loop on j should be parallelized and i privatized :

!$OMP PARALLEL DO PRIVATE(I)
      DO J = 1, NY                                                      0008

!$OMP    PARALLEL DO 
         DO I = 1, NX                                                   0009
            PHI(1,I,J) = 0.                                             0010
            PHI(2,I,J) = 0.                                             0011
            PHI(3,I,J) = 0.                                             0012
         ENDDO
