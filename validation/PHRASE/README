PHRASE uses advanced compilation techniques to ease the design and the programmation of high performance SoC with heterogeneous parallelism and (re)configurable hardware.

It is implemented with PIPS and has a back-end for the MADEO tool from UBO/AS to run on reconfigurable resources.
Description

    * some code marked by the user in the high level algorithm written in Fortran or C is transformed to a call to an hardware function with equivalent function
    * source to source transformations seen as hardware synthesis to investigate, optimize,... the application to run on various resources
    * use the PIPS array regions to compute the operand transfers from and to the hardware operators
    * control flow graph is flatten to generate the finite state machine equivalent code directly executable in hardware. The control flow graph hierarchy can be used to build a hierarchical finite state machine if asked
    * deal with multiple instance of the same hardware operator to use operator parallelism
    * a SmallTalk prettyprinter has been added to PIPS to link the internal representation to the MADEO tool that deal with the concrete hardware generation for reconfigurable hardware
    * since PIPS is a source-to-source compiler, the PHRASE output can still be done in C or Fortran to have a functional equivalent program seen as a soft simulator of the target architecture. It is quite useful for debugging or hardware/software performance comparison
    * software/hardware pipelining not finished yet.
