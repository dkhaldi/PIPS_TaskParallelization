/* Francois Irigoin: see how intersection is handled at the CP level
 * and at the PT level.
 *
 * Designed to think about Section 5.3.5 in Chapter 5, intersection
 * operator on Vref.
 *
 * In fact, the intersection operator in the PhD is implemented as a
 * conflict detection operator, references_may/must_conflict_p() in
 * effects-util/conflicts.c.
 *
 * The result is not as precise as it could/should be. The last update
 * of array "pp", "pp[l]=&pl;" does not invalidate the exactitude of
 * the arc "pp[1]->pl" because the target is the same in both cases.
